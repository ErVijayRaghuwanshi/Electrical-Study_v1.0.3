<h2 id="Electrical-DC-Circuit">Electrical DC Circuit</h2>
<h2 id="Definition-of-Electrical-Circuit">Definition of Electrical Circuit</h2>
<p>An <strong>electrical circuit</strong> is a combination of two or more electrical components which are interconnected by conducting paths. The components may be active or inactive or both. This is a very basic <strong>definition of electrical circuit</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="DC-Circuit">DC Circuit</h2>
<p>There are two types of electricity - direct  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#alternating-current" title="Alternating Current ">alternating current</a>, i.e, DC and AC. The circuit that deals with direct  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or DC, is referred as <strong>DC circuit</strong> and the circuit that deals with <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#alternating-current" title="Alternating Current ">alternating current</a> or AC, is generally referred as AC Circuit. The components of the <strong>electrical DC circuit</strong> are mainly resistive, whereas components of the AC circuit may be reactive as well as resistive. Any <strong>electrical circuit</strong> can be categorized into three different groups - series, parallel and series parallel. So for example, in the case of DC, the circuits can also be divided into three groups, such as <strong>series DC circuit</strong>, <strong>parallel DC circuit</strong> and <strong>series and parallel circuit</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Series-DC-Circuit">Series DC Circuit</h2>
<p>When all the resistive components of a <strong>DC circuit</strong> are connected end to end to form a single path for flowing  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> , then the circuit is referred as <strong>series DC circuit</strong>. The manner of connecting components end to end is known as series connection.</p>
<p>Suppose we have n number of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>............R<sub>n</sub> and they are connected in end to end manner, means they are series connected. If this series combination is connected across a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" >voltage source</a>, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  starts flowing through that single path. As the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are connected in end to end manner, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  first enters in to R<sub>1</sub>, then this same  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  comes in R<sub>2</sub>, then R<sub>3</sub> and at last it reaches R<sub>n</sub> from which the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  enters into the negative terminals of the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> . In this way, the same  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  circulates through every <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> connected in series. Hence, it can be concluded that in a <strong>series DC circuit</strong>, the same  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through all parts of the electrical circuit.</p>
</p>
<p>Again according to <a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html" title="Ohm’s Law">Ohm’s law</a> , the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is the product of its <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> and the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow through it. Here,  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through every <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is the same, hence the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across each <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>'s proportional to its <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a></a> value. If the resistances of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are not equal then the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across them would also not be equal. Thus, every <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> has its individual <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop in a <strong>series DC circuit</strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose three <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> are connected in series across a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  of V (quantified as volts) as shown in the figure. Let  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I (quantified as Ampere) flow through the series circuit.

<p><img src="../images01/series-circuits.gif" alt="electrical series dc circuit" title="Electrical DC Series Circuit"/></p>
<p><center><img src="../equations/dc1.gif" alt="""/></center></p>
<p>According to <a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html" title="Ohm’s Law">Ohm’s law</a> , the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> of an electrical circuit is given by V &frasl; I and that is R. Therefore,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/dc2.gif" alt="""/></center></p>
<p>So, effective <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the series <a href="../electrical-dc-series-and-parallel-circuit/index.html" title="DC Series and Parallel Circuit">DC circuit</a> is R = R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub> + R<sub>3</sub>. From the above expression it can be concluded, that when a number of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are connected in series, the equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the series combination is the arithmetic sum of their individual resistances.</p>
<p>From the above discussion, the following points come out:</p>
<ol>
<li>When a number of electrical components are connected in series, the same  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through all the components of the circuit.</li>
<li>The applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across a series circuit is equal to the sum total of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops across each component.</li>
<li>The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across individual components is directly proportional to its resistance value.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Parallel-DC-Circuit">Parallel DC Circuit</h2>
<p>When two or more electrical components are connected in a way that one end of each component is connected to a common point and the other end is connected to another common point, then the electrical components are said to be connected in parallel, and such an electrical <a href="../electrical-dc-series-and-parallel-circuit/index.html" title="DC Series and Parallel Circuit">DC circuit</a> is referred as a <strong>parallel DC circuit</strong>. In this circuit every component will have the same <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across them, and it will be exactly equal to the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> which occurs between the two common points where the components are connected. Also in a <strong>parallel DC circuit</strong>, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  has several parallel paths through these parallel connected components, so the circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will be divided into as many paths as the number of components.</p>
<p>Here in this electrical circuit, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across each component is equal. Again as per <a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html" title="Ohm’s Law">Ohm’s law</a> , <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across any resistive component is equal to the product of its <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through it. As the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across every component connected in parallel is the same, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through them is inversely proportional to its <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> value.</p>

<p>Suppose three <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> are connected in parallel across a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  of V (volt) as shown in the figure. Let I (Ampere) be the total circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  which is divided into  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>3</sub> flowing through R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> respectively.

<p><center><img src="../equations/dc4.gif" alt="""/></center></p>
<p><i>Thus when a number of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are connected in parallel, the reciprocal of the equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is given by the arithmetic sum of the reciprocals of their individual resistances.</i></p>
<p>From the above discussion of parallel DC circuit, we can come to the following conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Voltage drops are the same across all the components connected in parallel.</li>
<li>Current through individual components connected in parallel, is inversely proportional to their resistances.</li>
<li>Total circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is the arithmetic sum of the currents passing through individual components connected in parallel.</li>
<li>The reciprocal of equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the resistances of individual components connected in parallel.</li>
