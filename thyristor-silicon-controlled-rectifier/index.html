<p>A <strong>thyristor</strong> is normally four layer three-terminal device. Four layers are formed by alternating <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html"  >n – type and p – type semiconductor</a> materials. Consequently there are three p – n junctions formed in the device. It is a bistable device. The three terminals of this device are called anode (A), cathode (K) and gate (G) respectively. The gate (G) terminal is control terminal of the device. That means, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing through the device is controlled by electrical signal applied to the gate (G) terminal. The anode (A) and cathode (K) are the power terminals of the device handle the large applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and conduct the major  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the thyristor. For example, when the device is connected in series with load circuit, the load current  will flow through the device from anode (A) to cathode (K) but this load current  will be controlled by the gate(G) signal applied to the device externally. A <strong>tyristor</strong> is on – off switch which is used to control output power of an electrical circuit by switching on and off the load circuit periodically in a preset interval. The main difference of <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">thyristors</a> with other digital and electronics switches is that, a <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> can handle large  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and can withstand large voltage, whereas other digital and electronic switches handle only tiny  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and tiny voltage. </p>
<p>When positive potential applied to the anode with respect to the cathode, ideally no  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will flow through the device and this condition is called forward – blocking state but when appropriate gate signal is applied, a large forward anode current  starts flowing, with a small anode–cathode potential drop and the device becomes in forward-conduction state. Although after removing the gate signal, the device will remain in its forward-conduction mode until the polarity of the load reverses. Some <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">thyristors</a> are also controllable in switching from forward-conduction back to a forward-blocking state. </p>
</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-Thyristor">Application of Thyristor</h2>
<p>As we already said that a <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> is designed to handle large <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html"  >electric current</a> and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a>, it is used mainly in <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> circuit with system <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> more than 1 kV or currents more than 100 A. The main advantage of using <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">thyristors</a> as power control device is that as the power is controlled by periodic on – off switching operation hence (ideally) there is no internal power loss in the device for controlling power in output circuit. <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">Thyristors</a>  are commonly used in some alternating power circuits to control alternating output power of the circuit to optimize internal power loss at the expense of switching speed. </p>
<p>In this case <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">thyristors</a> are turned from forward-blocking into forward-conducting state at some predetermined phase angle of the input sinusoidal anode–cathode <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> waveform. </p>
<p> <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">Thyristors</a> are also very popularly used in inverter for converting direct power to alternating power of specified frequency. These are also used in converter to convert an alternating power into alternating power of different amplitude and frequency.This is the most common <strong>application of thyristor</strong>. </p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Thyristors">Types of <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">Thyristors</a> </h2>
<p>There are four major <strong>types of thyristors</strong>:<br />
(i)	Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR);<br />
(ii)	Gate Turn-off  Thyristor (GTO) and Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor (IGCT);<br />
(iii)	MOS-Controlled Thyristor (MCT)<br />
(iv)	Static Induction Thyristor (SITh). </p>
<h2 id="Basic-Construction-of-Thyristor">Basic Construction of Thyristor</h2>
<p>A high- resistive, n-base region, presents in every thyristor. As it is seen in the figure, this n-base region is associated with junction, J<sub>2</sub>. This must support the large applied forward voltages that occur when the switch is in its off- or forward-blocking state (non-conducting). This n-base region is typically doped with impurity phosphorous atoms at a concentration of 10<sup>13</sup> to 10<sup>14</sup> per cube centimeter. This region is typically made 10 to 100 micrometer thick to support large <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltages</a>. High-voltage <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">thyristors</a> are generally made by diffusing aluminum or gallium into both surfaces to create p-doped regions forming deep junctions with the n-base. The doping profile of the p-regions ranges from about 10<sup>15</sup> to 10<sup>17</sup> per cube centimeter. These p-regions can be up to tens of micrometer thick. The cathode region (typically only a few micrometer thick) is formed by using phosphorous atoms at a doping density of 10<sup>17</sup> to 10<sup>18</sup> cube centimeter. For higher forward-blocking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rating of thyristor, the n-base region is made thicker. But thicker n - based high-resistive region slows down on off operation of the device. This is because of more stored charge during conduction. A device rated for forward blocking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of 1 kV will operate much more slowly than the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> rated for 100 V. Thicker high-resistive region also causes larger forward <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop during conduction. Impurity atoms, such as platinum or gold, or electron irradiation are used to create charge-carrier recombination sites in the thyristor. The large number of recombination sites reduces the mean carrier lifetime (average time that an electron or hole moves through the Si before recombining with its opposite charge-carrier type). A reduced carrier lifetime shortens the switching times (in particular the turn-off or recovery time) at the expense of increasing the forward-conduction drop. There are other effects associated with the relative thickness and layout of the various regions that make up modern thyristors, but the major trade off between forward-blocking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rating and switching times and between forward-blocking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rating and forward-voltage drop during conduction should be kept in mind. (In signal-level electronics an analogous trade off appears as a lowering of amplification (gain) to achieve higher operating frequencies, and is often referred to as the gain-bandwidth product.)</p>
<h2 id="Basic-Operating-Principle-of-Thyristor">Basic Operating Principle of Thyristor</h2>
<p>Although there are different <strong>types of thyristors</strong> but <strong>basic operating principle of all thyristor</strong> more or less same. The figure below represents a conceptual view of a typical thyristor. There are three p–n junctions J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub> and J<sub>3</sub>. There are also three terminals anode (A), cathode (K) and gate (G) as levelled in the figure. When the anode (A) is in higher potential with respect to the cathode, the junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased and J2 is reverse biased and the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> is in the forward blocking mode. A <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> can be considered as back to back connected two bipolar transistors. A p-n-p-n structure of <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> can be represented by the p-n-p and n-p-n transistors, as shown in the figure. Here in this device, the collector  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of one transistor is used as base  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of other transistor. When the device is in forward blocking mode if a hole  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is injected through the gate (G) terminal, the device is triggered on. </p>
<p>When potential is applied in reverse direction, the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> behaves as a reverse biased <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html"  >diode</a>. That means it blocks  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to flow in revere direction. Considering I<sub>CO</sub> to be the leakage  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of each transistor in cut-off condition, the anode current  can be expressed in terms of gate current.<br />
<div id="attachment_15600" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 346px"><img src="../images/scr-01-13-06-14.gif" alt="schematic diagram of thyristor" width="336" height="363" class="size-full wp-image-15600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Schematic Diagram of Thyristor</p></div></p>
<p>Where &alpha; is the common base  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  gain of the transistor (&alpha; = I<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>E</sub>). The anode current  becomes arbitrarily large as (&alpha;<sub>1</sub> + &alpha;<sub>2</sub>) approaches unity. As the anode–cathode <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> increases, the depletion region expands and reduces the neutral base width of the n<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> regions. This causes a corresponding increase in the &alpha; of the two transistors. If a positive gate current of sufficient magnitude is applied to the thyristor, a significant amount of electrons will be injected across the forward-biased junction, J<sub>3</sub>, into the base of the n<sub>1</sub>p<sub>2</sub>n<sub>2</sub> transistor. The resulting collector  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  provides base  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to the p<sub>1</sub>n<sub>1</sub>p<sub>2</sub> transistor. The combination of the positive feedback connection of the npn and pnp BJTs and the current-dependent base transport factors eventually turn the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> on by regenerative action. Among the power <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html"  >semiconductor</a> devices known, the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> shows the lowest forward <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop at large  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  densities. The large  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow between the anode and cathode maintains both transistors in saturation region, and gate control is lost once the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> latches on.</p>
<h3 id="Transient-Operation-of-Thyristor">Transient Operation of Thyristor</h3>
<p>A <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> is not turned on as soon as the gate current is injected, there is one minimum time delay is required for regenerative action. After this time delay, the anode current  starts rising rapidly to on-state value. The rate of rising of anode current  can only be limited by external  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  elements. The gate signal can only turn on the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> but it cannot turn off the device.  It is turned off naturally when the anode current  tends to flow in reverse direction during the reverse cycle of the alternating current. A <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> exhibits turn-off reverse recovery characteristics just like a <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html"  >diode</a>. Excess charge is removed once the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  crosses zero and attains a negative value at a rate determined by external circuit elements. The reverse recovery peak is reached when either junction J<sub>1</sub> or J<sub>3</sub> becomes reverse biased. The reverse recovery  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  starts decaying, and the anode–cathode <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rapidly attains its off-state value. Because of the finite time required for spreading or collecting the charge plasma during turn-on or turn-off stage, the maximum dI/dt and dV/dt that may be imposed across the device are limited in magnitude. Further, device manufacturers specify a circuit-commutated recovery time, for the thyristor, which represents the minimum time for which the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> must remain in its reverse blocking mode before forward <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is reapplied.</p>
