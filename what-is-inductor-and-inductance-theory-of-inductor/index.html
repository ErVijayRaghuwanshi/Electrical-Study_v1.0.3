<h2 id="What-is-Inductor?">What is Inductor?</h2>
<p>Before knowing <strong>what is inductor</strong> we should first know the <strong>definition of inductance</strong>. </p>
<h4>Definition of Inductance</h4>
<p>If a changing flux is linked with a coil of a conductor there would be an emf induced in it. The property of the coil of inducing emf due to the changing flux linked with it is known as <strong>inductance of the coil</strong>. Due to this property all electrical coil can be referred as <strong>inductor</strong>. In other way, an <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> can be defined as an energy storage device which stores energy in form of <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a>.<br>
<img src="../images/magnetic-field-due-to-curre.jpg" alt="magnetic field due to current" width="350" height="232" class="alignright size-full wp-image-13353"></p>
<h2 id="Theory-of-Inductor">Theory of Inductor</h2>
<p>A <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> through a conductor produces a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> surround it. The strength of this field depends upon the value of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> passing through the conductor. The direction of the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> is found using the right hand grip rule, which shown. The flux pattern for this <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> would be number of concentric circle perpendicular to the detection of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a>.   </p>
<p>Now if we wound the conductor in form of a coil or solenoid, it can be assumed that there will be concentric circular flux lines for each individual turn of the coil as shown. But it is not possible practically, as if concentric circular flux lines for each individual turn exist, they will intersect each other. However, since lines of flux cannot intersect, the flux lines for individual turn will distort to form complete flux loops around the whole coil as shown. This flux pattern of a <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> carrying coil is similar to a flux pattern of a bar magnet as shown.<br>
<img src="../images/inductor-28-4-14.jpg" alt="inductor" width="350" height="216" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13355"><br>
Now if the current through the coil is changed, the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> produced by it will also be changed at same rate. As the flux is already surrounds the coil, this changing flux obviously links the coil. Now according to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, if changing flux links with a coil, there would be an induced emf in it. Again as per Lenz’s law this induced emf opposes every cause of producing it. Hence, the induced emf is in opposite of the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the coil.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-self-inductance">Definition of Self Inductance</h3>
<p>Whenever <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> flows through a circuit or coil, flux is produced surround it and this flux also links with the coil itself. Self induced emf in a coil is produced due to its own changing flux and changing flux is caused by changing <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> in the coil.  So, it can be concluded that self-induced emf is ultimately due to changing current in the coil itself. And self <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> is the property of a coil or solenoid, which causes a self-induced emf to be produced, when the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> through it changes.</p>
<h3 id="self-inductance-of-a-coil">Explanation of Self Inductance of a Coil</h3>
<p>Whenever changing flux, links with a circuit, an emf is induced in the circuit. This is Faraday’s laws of electromagnetic induction. According to this law,<br>
<img src='1.png' id="latexe%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B-%5C%3BN%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cphi%20%7D%7Bdt%7D%5C%3B%5Ccdots%20%5Ccdots%20%5Ccdots%20%5Ccdots%20%5Ccdots%20%5C%3B%28%5C%3B1%5C%3B%29&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="e\;=\;-\;N\frac{d\phi }{dt}\;\cdots \cdots \cdots \cdots \cdots \;(\;1\;)" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="e\;=\;-\;N\frac{d\phi }{dt}\;\cdots \cdots \cdots \cdots \cdots \;(\;1\;)"><br>
Where, e is the induced emf. N is the number of turns. (dφ/dt) is the rate of change of flux linkage with respect to time. The negative sign of the equation indicates that the induced emf opposes the change flux linkage. This is according to Len’z law of induction. The flux is changing due to change in <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> of the circuit itself. The produced flux due to a current, in a circuit, always proportional to that current. That means,<br>

Where, i is the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> in the circuit and K is the proportional constant.<br>
<img src='3.png' id="latexNow%2C%5C%3B%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cphi%20%7D%7Bdt%7D%5C%3B%3D%5C%3BK%5Cfrac%7Bdi%7D%7Bdt%7D%5C%3B%5Ccdots%5Ccdots%5Ccdots%5Ccdots%5Ccdots%5C%3B%28%5C%3B2%5C%3B%29&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="Now,\;\frac{d\phi }{dt}\;=\;K\frac{di}{dt}\;\cdots\cdots\cdots\cdots\cdots\;(\;2\;)" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="Now,\;\frac{d\phi }{dt}\;=\;K\frac{di}{dt}\;\cdots\cdots\cdots\cdots\cdots\;(\;2\;)"><br>
Now, from equation (1) and (2) we get,<br>
<img src='4.png' id="latexe%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B-%5C%3BNK%5Cfrac%7Bdi%7D%7Bdt%7D&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="e\;=\;-\;NK\frac{di}{dt}" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="e\;=\;-\;NK\frac{di}{dt}"><br>
The above equation can also be rewritten as<br>
<img src='5.png' id="latex-%20e%5C%3B%3D%5C%3BL%5Cfrac%7Bdi%7D%7Bdt%7D%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%283%29&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="- e\;=\;L\frac{di}{dt}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot(3)" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="- e\;=\;L\frac{di}{dt}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot(3)"><br>
Where, L (= NK) is the constant of proportionality and this L is defined as the self <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of the coil or solenoid. This L determines how much emf will be induced in a coil for a specific rate of change of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> through it.</p>
<p>Now, from equation (1) and (3), we get,<br>
<img src='6.png' id="latexL%5Cfrac%7Bdi%7D%7Bdt%7D%5C%3B%3D%5C%3BN%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cphi%7D%7Bdt%7D%5C%3B%5CRightarrow%5C%3BLdi%20%5C%3B%3D%5C%3BNd%5Cphi&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="L\frac{di}{dt}\;=\;N\frac{d\phi}{dt}\;\Rightarrow\;Ldi \;=\;Nd\phi" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="L\frac{di}{dt}\;=\;N\frac{d\phi}{dt}\;\Rightarrow\;Ldi \;=\;Nd\phi"><br>
Integrating, both sides we get,<br>
<img src='7.png' id="latex%5Cint%20Ldi%20%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B%5Cint%20Nd%5Cphi%20%5CRightarrow%20Li%20%3D%20N%5Cphi%5C%3B%5CRightarrow%20L%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B%5Cfrac%7BN%5Cphi%7D%7Bi%7D%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%284%29&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="\int Ldi \;=\;\int Nd\phi \Rightarrow Li = N\phi\;\Rightarrow L\;=\;\frac{N\phi}{i}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot(4)" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="\int Ldi \;=\;\int Nd\phi \Rightarrow Li = N\phi\;\Rightarrow L\;=\;\frac{N\phi}{i}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot(4)"><br>
From the above expression, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> can be also be defined as,<br>
“If the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> I through an N turn coil produces a flux of Ø Weber, then its self-inductance would be L”.<br>
A coil can be designed to have a specific value of self-inductance (L). In the view of self-inductance, a coil or solenoid is referred as an inductor. Now, if cross – sectional area of the core of the inductor(coil) is A and flux density in the core is B, then total flux inside the core of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> is AB.</p>
<p>Therefore, equation (4) can be written as<br>
<img src='8.png' id="latexL%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B%5Cfrac%7BNAB%7D%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="L\;=\;\frac{NAB}{i}" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="L\;=\;\frac{NAB}{i}"><br>
Now, B = μ<sub>o</sub>μ<sub>r</sub>H Where, H is <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> strength, µ<sub>o</sub> and μ<sub>r</sub> are permeability of free space and relative permeability of the core respectively. Now, H = mmf/unit length = Ni/l Where l is the length of the coil. Therefore,<br>

Which we derived at equation (3). Where, L is known is self induction of the circuit. In the above <strong>equation of inductance</strong>, if e = 1 Volt and (di / dt) is one ampere per second, then L = 1 and its unit is Henry. That means, if a circuit, produces emf of 1 Volt, due to rate of change of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> through it, one ampere per second then the circuit is said to have one henry self inductance. This henry is <strong>unit of inductance</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Mutual-Inductance">Mutual Inductance</h2>
<p>Inductance due to the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a>, through the circuit itself is called self inductance. But when a current flows through a circuit nearer to another circuit, then flux due to first circuit links to secondary circuit. If  this flux linkage changes with respect to time, there will be an induced emf in the second circuit. Similarly, if current flows through second circuit, it will produced flux, and if this <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> changes, the flux will also change. This changing flux will link with first coil. Due to this phenomenon emf will be induced in the first coil. This phenomenon is known as mutual inductance. If <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> i<sub>1</sub> flows through circuit 1 then emf e<sub>2</sub> is induced in the nearby circuit is given by,<br>

Where, M is the mutual inductance.<br>

<h3 id="Defination-of-Mutual-Inductance">Defination of Mutual Inductance</h3>
<p>Mutual <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> may be defined as the ability of one circuit to produce an emf in a nearby circuit by induction when <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> in the first circuit changes. In reverse way second circuit can also induce emf in the first circuit if <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> in the second circuit changes.</p>
<h3 id="Coefficient-of-Mutual-Inductance">Coefficient of Mutual Inductance</h3>
<p>Let’s consider two nearby coils of turns N<sub>1</sub> &amp; N<sub>2</sub> respectively. Let us again consider, current i<sub>1</sub> flowing through first coil produces φ<sub>1</sub>. If this whole of the flux links with second coil, the weber-turn in the second coil would be N<sub>2</sub>φ<sub>1</sub> due to current i<sub>1</sub> in the first coil. From this, it can be said, (N<sub>2</sub>φ<sub>1</sub>)/i<sub>1</sub> is the weber-turn of the second coil due to unit current in the first coil. This term is defined as co-efficient of mutual inductance. That means, mutual <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> between two coils or circuits is defined as the weber-turns in one coil or circuit due to 1 A current in the other coil or circuit.</p>
<h3 id="Formula-of-Mutual-Inductance">Formula or Equation of Mutual Inductance</h3>
<p>Now we have already found that, mutual <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> due to <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> in first coil is,<br>

This is an ideal case, when whole changing flux of one coil, links to other coil. The value of M practically not equal to √(L<sub>1</sub>L<sub>2</sub>) as because whole flux of one coil does not link with other , rather, a part of flux of one coil, links with other coil. Hence practically,<br>

If flux of one coil is entirely links with other, then value of K will be one. This is an ideal case. This is not possible, but when K nearly equal to unity, that means, maximum flux of one coil links to other, the coils are said to be tightly coupled or closely coupled. But when no flux of one coil links with other, the value of K becomes zero (K = 0), then the coils are said to be very loosely coupled or isolated.</p>
<h3 id="Mutual-Inductance-of-Coils">Mutual Inductance of two Solenoids or Coils</h3>
<p>Let us assume two solenoids or coils A and B respectively.<br>
<img src="../images/mutual-inductance-1.jpg" alt="mutual inductance" width="600" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14890"><br>
Coil A is connected with an alternating <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> , V. Due to alternating source connected to coil A, it will produce an alternating flux as shown. Now, if we connect on sensitive voltmeter across coil B, we will find a non zero reading on it. That means, some emf is induced in the coil B. This is because, apportion of flux produced by coil A, links with coil B and as the flux changes in respect of time, there will be an induced emf in the coil B according to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. This phenomenon is called mutual induction. That means, induction of emf in one coil due to flux of other coil is mutual induction.<br>
<img src="../images/mutual-induction-21.jpg" alt="mutual induction" width="600" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14943"><br>
Similarly, if the alternating <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  was connected to coil B and induced <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is measured by connecting voltmeter across coil A, the voltmeter gives a non-zero reading. That means, in this case the emf will be induced in coil A due to flux linkage from coil B. Let us consider coil A and B have turns N<sub>1</sub> &amp; N<sub>2</sub>. If the entire flux of coil A links with coil B, then weber-turns of the coil B due to unit <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> of coil A, would be (N<sub>2</sub>φ<sub>1</sub>)/i<sub>1</sub>, where, φ<sub>1</sub> &amp; i<sub>1</sub> is flux and current of coil A. As per definition this is nothing but mutual <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of coil A &amp; B, M.

<h2 id="Inductances-in-Series">Inductances in Series</h2>
<p>Let’s coil or <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> A and B are connected in series. The self <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of coil A , is L<sub>A</sub> and that of coil B is L<sub>B</sub>. Now again consider, M is the mutual <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> between them. There may be two conditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>The direction of flux produced by both coil will be in same direction. In that case, the flux of coil B links will be coil A, will be in same direction with the flux produced by coil A, itself. Hence, the effective <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of coil A will be L<sub>A</sub> + M.<br>
At the same time, the flux of coil A, links with coil B will be in same direction with self flux of coil B. Hence, the effective <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of coil B will be L<sub>B</sub> + M.<br>
Hence total effective <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of the series connected <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  A and B will be nothing but,<p></p>
<p><img src='27.png' id="latexL_A%5C%3B%2B%5C%3BM%5C%3B%2B%5C%3BL_B%5C%3B%2B%5C%3BM%5C%3B%3D%5C%3BL_A%5C%3B%2B%5C%3BL_B%5C%3B%2B%5C%3B2M&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="L_A\;+\;M\;+\;L_B\;+\;M\;=\;L_A\;+\;L_B\;+\;2M" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="L_A\;+\;M\;+\;L_B\;+\;M\;=\;L_A\;+\;L_B\;+\;2M"></p></li>
<li>Now, if direction of instantaneous flux at coil A and B are in opposite, then flux of coil B linking with coil A, will be in opposite direction of flux produced by coil A itself. So, effective <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of coil A will be L<sub>A</sub> - M.
<p>In the same way, the flux of coil A which links with coil B, will be in opposite direction of self flux of coil B.<br>
Hence, effective <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of coil B will be, L<sub>B</sub> - M.</p>
<p>So, total <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> in series in this case will be,<br>
<img src='28.png' id="latexL_A%5C%3B-%5C%3BM%5C%3B%2B%5C%3BL_B%5C%3B-%5C%3BM%5C%3B%3D%5C%3BL_A%5C%3B%2B%5C%3BL_B%5C%3B-%5C%3B2M&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="L_A\;-\;M\;+\;L_B\;-\;M\;=\;L_A\;+\;L_B\;-\;2M" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="L_A\;-\;M\;+\;L_B\;-\;M\;=\;L_A\;+\;L_B\;-\;2M"><br>
So, general form of equivalent <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of two <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  in series in,<br>

<h2 id="Types-of-Inductor">Types of Inductor</h2>
<p><img src="../images/inductor-1.jpg" alt="fixed inductor" width="201" height="174" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14435">There are many types of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a> ; all differ in size, core material, type of windings, etc. so they are used in wide range of applications. The maximum capacity of the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> gets specified by the type of core material and the number of turns on coil.</p>
<p>Depending on the value, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  typically exist in two forms, fixed and variable. .The number of turns of the fixed coil remains the same. This type is like <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s in shape and they can be distinguished by the fact that the first color band in fixed <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> is always silver. They are usually used in electronic equipment as in radios, communication apparatus, electronic testing instruments, etc. </p>
<p>The number of turns of the coil in variable <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a> , changes depending on the design of the inductor. Some of them are designed to have taps to change the number of turns. The other design is fabricated to have a many fixed <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  for which, it can be switched into parallel or series combinations. They often get used in modern electronic equipment.</p>
<p>Core or heart of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> is the main part of the inductor. Some types of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> depending on the material of the core will be discussed. </p>
<h3 id="Ferromagnetic-Core-Inductor-or-Iron-core-Inductors">Ferromagnetic Core Inductor or Iron-core Inductors</h3>
<p><img src="../images/inductor-2.jpg" alt="ferromagnetic inductor" width="201" height="151" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14436"><br>
This type uses ferromagnetic materials such as ferrite or iron in manufacturing the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> for increasing the inductance. Due to the high magnetic permeability of these materials, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> can be increased in response of increasing the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a>. </p>
<p> At high frequencies it suffers from core loses, energy loses, that happens in ferromagnetic cores. </p>
<h3 id="Air-Core-Inductor">Air Core Inductor</h3>
<p><img src="../images/inductor-3.jpg" alt="air core inductor" width="201" height="151" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14438"><br>
Air cored <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> is the type where no solid core exists inside the coils. In addition, the coils that wound on nonmagnetic materials such as ceramic and plastic, are also considered as air cored. This type does not use magnetic materials in its construction.</p>
<p>The main advantage of this form of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  is that, at high <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> strength, they have a minimal signal loss. On the other hand, they need a bigger number of turns to get the same <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> that the solid cored <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  would produce. They are free of core losses because they are not depending on a solid core.</p>

It works pretty well in AC electronic circuits' application.<p></p>
<p>The advantage of this type is that, due to its symmetry, it has a minimum loss in magnetic flux; therefore it radiates less electromagnetic interference near circuits or devices. Electromagnetic interference is very important   in electronics that require high frequency and low power.</p>
<h3 id="Laminated-Core-Inductor">Laminated Core Inductor</h3>

<p>This form gets typified by its stacks made with thin steel sheets, on top of each other designed to be parallel to the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> covered with insulating paint on the surface; commonly on oxide finish. It aims to block the eddy <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a>s between steel sheets of stacks so the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">current</a> keeps flowing through its sheet and minimizing loop area for which it leads to great decrease in the loss of energy. Laminated core <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> is also a low frequency inductor. It is more suitable and used in transformer applications.</p>

Powdered Iron Core</p></div>Its core gets constructed by using  magnetic materials that get characterized by its distributed air gaps. This gives the advantage to the core to store a high level of energy comparing to other types. In addition, very good <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> stability is gained with low losses in eddy current and hysteresis. Moreover, it has the lowest cost alternative. <p></p>
<h2 id="Another-Classification-of-Inductor">Another Classification of Inductor</h2>
<h3 id="Coupled-Inductor">Coupled Inductor</h3>
<p>It happens when <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  are related to each other by electromagnetic induction. Generally it gets used in applications as transformers and where the mutual <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> is required.</p>
<h3 id="RF-Inductor">RF Inductor</h3>
<p>Another name is radio frequency of RF <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a> . This type operates at high frequency ranges. It is characterized by low current rating and high electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. However, it suffers from a proximity effect, where the wire <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> increases at high frequencies. <a href="../skin-effect-in-transmission-lines/">Skin effect</a>, where the wire <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> to high frequency is greater than the electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of current direct.</p>

<h3 id="Molded-Inductor">Molded Inductor</h3>
<p>The material for which it stands from, is molded on ceramic or plastic. Molded <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  are typically available in bar and cylindrical shapes with a variety option of windings.</p>

<p>The main purpose of it is to block high frequencies and pass low frequencies. It exists in two types; RF chokes and power chokes.</p>
<h2 id="Applications-of-Inductors">Applications of Inductors</h2>
<p>In general there are a lot of applications due to a big variety of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a> . Here are some of them. Generally the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  are very suitable for radio frequency, suppressing noise, signals, isolation and for high power applications.</p>
<p>More applications summarized here:<br>
1.	Energy Storage<br>
2.	Sensors<br>
3.	Transformers<br>
4.	Filters<br>
5.	Motors</p>
<p>The use of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a>  somehow is restricted due to its ability of radiation of electromagnetic interference. In addition, it is a side effect which makes <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> deviate a little bit from it is real behavior.</p>
