<p>Speed control means  intentional change of the drive speed to a value required for performing the specific work process.  Speed control  is a different concept from speed regulation  where  there is natural change in speed due change in load on the shaft. Speed control is either done manually by the operator or by means of some automatic control device.</p>
<p>One of the important features of dc motor is that its speed can be controlled with relative ease. We know that the expression of speed control dc motor is given as,</p>
<p><img src='1.png' id="latexN%5C%3B%20%3D%5C%3B%20K%20V%5C%3B-%20%5C%3B%5Cfrac%7B%20I_a%20%28R_a%5C%3B%20%2B%5C%3B%20R%29%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='N\; =\; K V\;- \;\frac{ I_a (R_a\; +\; R)}{\phi}' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='N\; =\; K V\;- \;\frac{ I_a (R_a\; +\; R)}{\phi}' /> </p>
<p>Therefore speed (N ) of  3 types of dc motor – SERIES, SHUNT  AND COMPOUND   can be controlled by changing the quantities on RHS of the expression.  So speed can be varied by changing</p>
<p>(i)	terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the armature V , </p>
<p>(ii)	 external <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in armature circuit R and </p>
<p>(iii)	 flux per pole &phi; . </p>
<p>The first two cases involve change that affects armature circuit and the third one involves change in <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>.  Therefore speed control of dc motor is classified as </p>
<p>1)	armature control methods and</p>
<p>2)	 field control  methods. </p>
<h2 id="1">Speed Control of DC Series Motor</h2>
<p>Speed control of dc series motor can be done either by armature control or by field control.</p>
<h3 id="2">Armature  Control of DC Series Motor</h3>
<p>Speed adjustment of dc series motor by armature control may be done by any one of the methods that follow,</p>
<p>1.	Armature <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> control method: This is the most common method employed.  Here the controlling <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is connected directly in series with the supply to the motor as shown in the fig.<br />
diagram</p>
</p>
<p>The power loss in the control <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of dc series motor can be neglected because this control method is utilized for a large portion of time for reducing the speed under light load condition. This method of speed control is most economical for constant torque. This method of speed control is employed for dc series motor driving cranes, hoists, trains etc. </p>
<p>2.	Shunted armature control: The combination of a rheostat shunting the armature and a rheostat in series with the armature is involved in this method of speed control. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> applied to the armature is varies by varying series rheostat   R <sub>1</sub>. The exciting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  can be varied by varying the armature shunting <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R<sub>2</sub>. This method of speed control is not economical due to considerable power losses in speed controlling <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s.  Here speed control is obtained over wide range but below normal speed.<br />
Diagram :</p>
<p>3.	Armature terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> control: The speed control of dc series motor can be accomplished by supplying the power to the motor from a separate variable <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> supply. This method involves high cost so it rarely used.</p>
<h3 id="3">Field Control of DC Series Motor</h3>
<p>The speed of dc motor can be controlled by this method by  any one of the following ways –</p>
<p>1.	Field diverter method:  This method uses a diverter. Here the field flux can be reduced by shunting a portion of motor  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  around the series field. Lesser the diverter <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> less is the field current, less flux therefore more speed. This method gives speed above normal and the method is used in electric drives in which speed should rise sharply as soon as load is decreased.diagram</p>
<p>2.	Tapped Field control: This is another method of increasing the speed by reducing the flux and it is done by lowering number of turns of field winding through which  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows.  In this method a number of tapping from field winding are brought outside . This method is employed in electric traction.  </p>
<p>Diagram</p>
<h2 id="4">Speed Control of DC Shunt Motor</h2>
<p>Speed of dc shunt motor is controlled by the factors stated below</p>
<h3 id="5">Field Control of DC Shunt Motor</h3>
<p>By this method speed control is obtained by any one of the following means –</p>
<p>1.	Field rheostat control of DC Shunt Motor: In this method , speed variation is accomplished by means of a variable <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> inserted  in series with the shunt field . An increase in controlling <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s reduces the field  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  with a reduction in flux and an increase in speed. This method of speed control is independent of load on the motor. Power wasted in controlling <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is very less as field  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is a small value.  This method of speed control is also used in DC compound motor.</p>
<p>Limitations of this method of speed control:</p>
<p>A.	Creeping speeds cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>B.	Top speeds only obtained at reduced torque </p>
<p>C.	The speed is maximum at minimum value of flux, which is governed by the demagnetizing effect of armature reaction on the field. </p>
<p>2.	Field <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> control: This method requires a variable <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> supply for the field circuit which is separated from the main power supply to which the armature is connected. Such a variable supply can be obtained by an electronic rectifier.</p>
<h3 id="6">Armature Control of DC Shunt Motor</h3>
<p>Speed control by this method involves two ways . These are :</p>
<p>1.	Armature <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> control   : In this method armature circuit is provided with a variable <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. Field is directly connected across the supply so flux is not changed due to variation of series <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. This is applied for dc shunt motor. This method is used in printing press, cranes, hoists where speeds lower than rated is used for a short period only. </p>
<p>2.	Armature <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> control:  This method of speed control  needs a variable source of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> separated from the source supplying the field current. This method avoids disadvantages of poor speed regulation and low efficiency of armature-<a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> control methods. The basic adjustable armature <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> control method of speed d control is accomplished by means of an adjustable <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> generator is called Ward Leonard system. This method involves using a motor –generator (M-G) set.  This method is best suited for steel rolling mills, paper machines, elevators, mine hoists, etc. </p>
<p>Advantages of this method –</p>
<p>A.	Very fine speed control  over whole range in both directions </p>
<p>B.	Uniform acceleration is obtained</p>
<p>C.	Good speed regulation</p>
<p>Disadvantages –</p>
<p>A.	Costly arrangement is needed , floor space  required is more</p>
<p>B.	Low efficiency at light loads</p>
