<p>During World II it became essential to have constant voltage, high capacity, long life  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  system for using under extreme tropical condition. The technology of zinc mercuric oxide  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  had been known for more than 100 years, but it was first practically used by Samuel Ruben during World II. Because of its constant and stable <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> characteristics, it is particularly advantageous to use if watches, cameras, and other small electronics devices. It was also used in some early model of pacemakers. Because of its extremely stable output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> characteristic, the mercuric oxide  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  was widely used as a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> reference source in electrical measuring instrument. In addition to these the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  were also used in small scatterable satellite mines, radio sets and early satellites.</p>
<p>Now a days these  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are becoming obsolete because of its environmental problem associates with mercury. There are mainly two types of mercuric oxide  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  – one zinc mercuric oxide  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  and two cadmium mercuric oxide  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  . Environmental problems are also associated with cadmium.  The market of this  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  has been occupied by alkaline manganese dioxide, zinc-air, silver oxide and lithium  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> .</p>

<h2 id="Construction-of-Mercuric-Oxide-Battery"> Construction of Mercuric Oxide Battery</h2>
<p>These  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  were mainly manufactured in bottom, flat and cylindrical shape. In bottom configuration, top cover of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is made of copper alloy on the inner face and nickel or stainless steel on the outer face. The top cover is insulated from the bottom container by a nylon grommet. Amalgamated zinc powder is dispersed inside the top cover. The lower portion of the container is filled with a mixture of mercuric oxide and graphite. Graphite helps here to increase the conductivity of mercuric oxide. The mercuric oxide is the main cathode material of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  . The top of the cathode mixture is covered with potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide electrolyte soaked porous barrier. Now the whole top cover along with grommet and anode material is pressed down in the bottom container. Now the upper portion of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is anode, the lower portion is cathode and the porous separator contains the electrolyte in between them. The whole assembly is tightly held together by crimping the top edge of the bottom can or container. In flat configuration, zinc powder is amalgamated and pressed into a pellet. The top cover of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is double plated with integrally molded polymer grommet. The outer and inner top plates are made of nickel plated steel, but inner plate is tin plated on inner surface. The main container of the cell is also made of two nickel plated steel made cans. And the adapter tube is placed in the space in between the inner and outer can. The lower portion of the container is filled with cathode mixture and on the top of the cathode mixture electrolyte absorbents is placed. The top grommet assembly along with anode pallet is pressed into the inner can and seal being done by crimping over the outer can. A vent hole is provided in the outer can so that the gas which might be generated during discharge can easily be escaped between inner and outer cans, any entrained electrolyte being absorbed by the paper adaptor tube.</p>
<h2 id="Chemistry-of-Mercuric-Oxide-Battery">Chemistry of Mercuric Oxide Battery</h2>
<p>Two types of alkaline electrolyte are used in the zinc / mercuric cell, one based potassium hydroxide and other is sodium hydroxide. The sodium hydroxide electrolyte is generally used where low temperature operation and high current drain are not essential. This electrolyte is generally used in zinc mercuric oxide cell, whereas potassium hydroxide based electrolyte is only used in cadmium mercuric oxide cell. Cadmium is insoluble in potassium hydroxide solution and that is why the cadmium mercuric oxide cell is quite suitable for low temperature operation.</p>
