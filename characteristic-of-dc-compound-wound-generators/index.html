In <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Compound_Wound_DC_Generator"  >compound wound DC generators</a> both the field windings are combined (series and shunt). This <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/index.html"  >type of generators</a> can be used as either long shunt or short shunt compound wound generators as shown in the diagram below. In both the cases the external characteristic of the generator will be nearly same. The compound wound generators may be cumulatively compounded or differentially compounded (discussed earlier in the <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/index.html"  >type of generators</a>). Differentially compound wound generators are very rarely used. So, here we mainly concentrate upon the characteristic of <strong>cumulatively compound wound generators</strong>.<br />
<img src="../images/short-shunt-dc-generator.png" alt="short shunt dc generator" width="426" height="322" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8049" /><br />
We all know that, in <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Series_Wound_Generator"  >series wound DC generators</a>, the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is directly proportional with load current  and in <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Shunt_Wound_DC_Generators"  >shunt wound DC generators</a>, output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is inversely proportional with load current. The  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> in the shunt field winding produces a flux which causes a fall in terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> due to armature reaction and ohmic  drop in the circuit. But the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the series field also produces a flux which opposes the shunt field flux and compensate the drop in the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and try to operate the machine at constant voltage.<br />

The combination of a series generator and a shunt generator gives the characteristic of a cumulative compound wound generator.</p>
<p>At no load condition there is no  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the series field because the load terminals are open circuited. But the shunt field  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  helps to produce field flux and excite the machine.  When the <a href="../principle-of-dc-generator/index.html"  >dc generator</a> supplies load, the load current  increases and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through the series field. Therefore, series field also provides some field flux and emf is also increased. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop in the shunt machine is therefore compensated by the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rise in the series machine. </p>
</p>
<p>External <strong>characteristic of DC compound wound generator</strong> is drawn between the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and the load current.By adjusting the no. of amp-turns in the series field winding we can get following external characteristics:</p>
<p>1.	If the series turns are so adjusted that with the increase in load current  the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> also increases, then the generator is called over compounded. The curve AB in the figure showing this characteristic. When the load current  increases then the flux provides by the series field also increases. It gives the additional generated voltage. If the increase in generated <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is greater than the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops due to armature reaction and ohmic drop then, terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the generator is increased.</p>
<p>2.	If the series turns are so adjusted that with the increase in load current  the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> remains constant, then the generator is called flat compounded. The curve AC in the figure showing this characteristic. When the load current  increases then the flux provides by the series field also increases and gives the additional generated voltage. If the increase in generated <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is equal to the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops due to armature reaction and ohmic drop then, rated terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the generator remains same as no load voltage.</p>
<p>3.	If the series field winding has lesser no. of turns then the rated terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> becomes less than the no load voltage, then the generator is called under compounded. Because, the increase in generated <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is lesser than the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops due to armature reaction and ohmic drop. Curve AD in the figure is showing this characteristic.</p>

<p>For small distance operation the flat compounded generators are generally used because the length of the feeder is negligible. But to maintain constant <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> over a long period, the over compounded generators are used. It works as a generator and a booster (boost the terminal voltage).</p>
