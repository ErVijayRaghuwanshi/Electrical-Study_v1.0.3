<h2 id="What-is-a-Diode?">What is a Diode?</h2>
<p>A <strong>diode</strong> is a simple electrical device that allows the flow of current only in one direction. So it can be said to act somewhat like a switch. A specific arrangement of <strong>diodes</strong> can convert AC to pulsating DC, hence it is sometimes also called as a rectifier. It is derived from "di-ode " which means a device having two electrodes. The symbol of a <a href="../p-n-junction-diode/" title="Diode ">p-n junction diode</a> is shown below, the arrowhead points in the direction of conventional  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow.<img src="../images/Diode-1-27-12-13.gif" alt="Diode-1-27-12-13" width="571" height="245" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9730"><br>
The p-n junction is a basic building block in any <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> device. It is formed by joining a p type (<a href="../intrinsic-silicon-and-extrinsic-silicon/">intrinsic semiconductor</a> doped with a trivalent impurity) and n type <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> (intrinsic <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> doped with a pentavalent impurity) together with a special fabrication technique such that a p-n junction is formed. Hence it is a device with two elements, the p-type forms anode and the n-type forms the cathode. These terminals are brought out to make the external connections.</p>
<h2 id="Working-Principle-of-Diode">Working Principle of Diode</h2>
<h3 id="What-happens-Inside-the-p-n-Junction-Diode?">What happens Inside the p-n Junction Diode?</h3>
<p>The n side will have large number of electrons and very few holes (due to thermal excitation) whereas the p side will have high concentration of holes and very few electrons. Due to this a process called diffusion takes place. In this process free electrons from the n side will diffuse (spread) into the p side and combine with holes present there, leaving a positive immobile (not moveable) ion in the n side. Hence few atoms on the p side are converted into negative ions. Similarly few atoms on the n-side will get converted to positive ions. Due to this large number of positive ions and negative ions will accumulate on the n-side and p-side respectively. This region so formed is called as depletion region. Due to the presence of these positive and negative ions a <a href="../static-electric-field/">static electric field</a> called as "barrier potential" is created across the p-n junction of the diode. It is called as "barrier potential" because it acts as a barrier and opposes the flow of positive and negative ions across the junction.</p>
<p>To make use of this <a href="../p-n-junction-diode/" title="Diode ">p-n junction diode</a> we have to apply an external DC <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to it. Applying an external DC <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is called as biasing. If the p-side (anode) is connected to the positive terminal of the supply and the n-side (cathode) to the negative terminal of the supply, the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is said to be forward biased. In the same way if the n-side is connected to the positive terminal of the supply and the p-side to the negative terminal of the supply, the <strong>diode</strong> is said to be reversed biased. Most of the times a <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> has to be connected in series with it to limit the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing through the diode. This is the <strong>working principle of diode</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="What-happen-When-the-Diode-is-Forward-Biased?">What happen When the Diode is Forward Biased?</h2>
<p>When the <strong>diode</strong> is forward biased, due to the negative terminal on the n-side, electrons from the n-side are pushed towards the p-region. Similarly due to positive <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> on the p-side of the diode, Holes from the p-region are pushed towards n-side. Due to this the electrons will start converting the positive ions in the p-region into neutral atoms and holes will start converting the negative ions in the n-region to neutral atoms. Hence width of the depletion region starts reducing due to reduction in the barrier potential. (As the atoms in the depletion region are getting converted into neutral atoms less and less charged ions remain in this region with increase in supply voltage, hence width decreases.) This keeps happening and at a certain point the depletion region collapses and there is no opposition to the flow of current. Hence large number of electrons and holes will cross the junction and make the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to flow from anode to cathode.<br>
Hence, forward biased electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is very small and hence there is a small <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/">voltage</a> drop (Practical condition, ideally there should be 0 forward <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>) across it. Its value for silicon <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is about 0.7 V.<br>
Thus the <a href="../p-n-junction-diode/" title="Diode ">p-n junction diode</a> will allow a  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to pass through it only when it is forward biased.<br>
<img src="../images/Diode-2-27-12-13.gif" alt="Diode-2-27-12-13" width="396" height="235" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9731"></p>
<h2 id="What-happens-in-the-Reverse-Biased-Condition?">What happens in the Reverse Biased Condition?</h2>
<p>When the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is reverse biased the hole from the p-side will get attracted towards the negative terminal of the supply and electrons from the n-side are attracted towards the positive terminal. Hence the process of widening of the depletion region takes place and hence more and more opposition to the flow of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  takes place.<br>
 <img src="../images/Diode-3-27-12-13.gif" alt="Diode-3-27-12-13" width="371" height="222" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9732"><br>
Hence, ideally the reverse biased <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is infinite and no  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows from the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> when it is reversed biased. Due to large reverse biased voltage, suddenly large  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will flow through the reverse biased voltage. Due to this large power gets dissipated in the <strong>diode</strong> which may damage it permanently.  </p>
