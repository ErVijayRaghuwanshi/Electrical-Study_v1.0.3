<p>Distribution in simple words means to make available a number of product or services to end customers. Same is the case when we are talking about electrical distribution system. Means making available that 415v or 240v to a number of end consumers through a distribution system.<br />
The generation normally takes place around 11 Kv to 25 Kv which is generally termed as medium voltage. Since we all aware of the fact that this is not the proper <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> for transmission. So this volage is the stepped up to a level of 220 kv or 400 kv or 132 kv depending on the power transmitted or we can say that depends upon the distance. This power is carried away through a transmission network of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> lines. These transmission lines are of hundreds of kilometers. These lines are then terminated to some substations which step down the desired <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to either 11kv or 33 kv or 66 kv. This can be termed as sub transmission network.<br />
Now if we are particularly taking about distribution network then everything below 33kv i.e 11 kv feeders emarates from 33 kv is branched into several 11 kv feeders. The main moto of these 11 kv feeders is to carry power close to the nearby localities which include industrial area, villages etc. here the transformer further reduce the 11 kv to 415v or 240v and it provides the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> through 415v feeders which inturn gives 415v  or 240 v. now 415v is a three phase supply so this is given to the places where we have to give three phase supply. Similarly you all are aware of 220 v supply, its a single phase and is used in homes.</p>
<p>Example of Simple distribution system<br />
Let it there are 4 generating unit generating a total of 20kv this is step up to 400kv and transmitted to the distribution network as explained above<br />
 The distributing substation receive it as either 66/33/11Kv<br />
there may be chance that there are seperate 66kv feeders but at the end..those 11 kv or 33 kv are directly given to DISCOMS.<br />
So in short if i am saying distribution system then it starts from 33or 11 kv downwards<br />
this is step down to 430/250 v for the customers by considering the fact that there is <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop in transmission lines</p>
<p>A simple example demonstates this<br />
Input HT lines 11kv from X grid<br />
                         11 kv from Y grid<br />
transformer rated primary <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> 11kv<br />
secondary <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> 416/240 v</p>
</p>
<p>For domestic users a phase and a neutral connection is supplied and for heavy load 3 wire connection is supplied<br />
For the distribution to the consumer end, we can use either overhead line or underground line. Underground one are good in appearance and safe but they are costly one.<br />
A typical lenght of 11 kv feeder on city os around 3 km. where as in rural areas this lenghth is upto 15-18 kms.<br />
A 415 feeder normally is of 0.5m to 1 km max</p>
<p>Ring Main Unit - RMU<br />
It is mainly used by distributors<br />
 when more than one feeder is supplying input and in case of failure from any feeder, powers can be fed uninteruptlily from other feeders at same point. Now a days it is of SF6 type. It is used for two inputs or one outgoing to the load  or one input or two outgoing to the load. </p>
<p>Electricity supply to consumersThe secondary winding of the transformer is mostly of wye connection type.This supply system with a neutral wire is termed as 4 wire 3 phase supply.4 wire supplies are normally used to distribute domestic supplies since they can provide an earthed neutral. The three phase wires together give a 3-phase 3-wire supply (240x1.73=415Volts) suitable or heavy machinery such as 3-phase motors.</p>
<p>Isuues in distribution Power system<br />
Lack of priority is given to 33kv substations related to load and maintanance also the health status of 11KV/415V<br />
Absence of monitoring, overloading, reult in the improper <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> distribution which also leads to the breakdown of equipment at consumer end<br />
We are currently using circuit breakers for load management<br />
moreover we don't have switches in distribution network, in order to isolate certain loads for loadshedding purpose.what we know have CB(circuit breakers) for 11kv feeders. So when desired it will leads to the isolation of that particular network</p>
