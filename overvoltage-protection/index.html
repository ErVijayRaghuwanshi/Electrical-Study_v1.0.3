<p>There are always a chance of suffering an electrical power system from abnormal over voltages. These abnormal over voltages may be caused due to various reason such as, sudden interruption of heavy load, lightening impulses, switching impulses etc. These over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stresses may damage insulation of various equipments and insulators of the power system. Although, all the over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stresses are not strong enough to damage insulation of system, but still these over voltages also to be avoided to ensure the smooth operation of electrical power system.</p>
<p>These all types of destructive and non destructive abnormal over voltages are eliminated from the system by means of <strong>overvoltage protection</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Voltage-Surge">Voltage Surge</h2>
<p>The over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stresses applied upon the power system, are generally transient in nature. Transient <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> surge is defined as sudden sizing of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to a high peak in very short duration. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> surges are transient in nature, that means they exist for very short duration. The main cause of these <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> surges in power system are due to lightning impulses and switching impulses of the system. But over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in the power system may also be caused by, insulation failure, arcing ground and resonance etc.</p>
<p>The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> surges appear in the electrical power system due to switching surge, insulation failure, arcing ground and resonance are not very large in magnitude. These over voltages hardly cross the twice of the normal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level. Generally, proper insulation to the different equipment of power system is sufficient to prevent any damage due to these over voltages. But over voltages occur in the power system due to lightning is very high. If over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> protection is not provided to the power system, there may be high chance of severe damage. Hence all over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> protection devices used in power system mainly due to lightning surges.</p>
</p>
<p>Let us discuss different causes of over voltages one by one.</p>
<h3 id="Switching-Impulse-or-Switching-Surge">Switching Impulse or Switching Surge</h3>
<p>When a no load transmission line is suddenly switched on, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> on the line becomes twice of normal system voltage. This <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is transient in nature. When a loaded line is suddenly switched off or interrupted, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the line also becomes high enough  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  chopping in the system mainly during opening operation of <a href="../air-circuit-breaker-air-blast-circuit-breaker/index.html"  >air blast circuit breaker</a>, causes over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in the system. During insulation failure, a live conductor is suddenly earthed. This may also caused sudden over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in the system. If emf wave produced by <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html"  >alternator</a> is distorted, the trouble of resonance may occur due to 5<sup>th</sup> or higher harmonics. Actually for frequencies of 5<sup>th</sup> or higher harmonics, a critical situation in the system so appears, that inductive reactance of the system becomes just equal to capacitive reactance of the system. As these both reactance cancel each other the system becomes purely resistive. This phenomenon is called resonance and at resonance the system <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> may be increased enough.</p>
<p>But all these above mentioned reasons create over voltages in the system which are not very high in magnitude.</p>
<p>But over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> surges appear in the system due to lightning impulses are very high in amplitude and highly destructive. The affect of lightning impulse hence must be avoided for over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> protection of power system.</p>
<h3 id="Methods-of-Protection-Against-Lightning">Methods of Protection Against Lightning</h3>
<p>These are mainly three main methods generally used for protection against lightning. They are</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Earthing screen</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Overhead earth wire</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Lighning arrester or surge dividers</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Earthing-Screen">Earthing Screen</h4>
<p>Earthing screen is generally used over <a href="../electrical-power-substation-engineering-and-layout/index.html"  >electrical sub-station</a>. In this arrangement a net of GI wire is mounted over the sub-station. The GI wires, used for earthing screen are properly grounded through different sub-station structures. This network of grounded GI wire over <a href="../electrical-power-substation-engineering-and-layout/index.html"  >electrical sub-station</a>, provides very low <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> path to the ground for lightning strokes.</p>
<p>This method of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> protection is very simple and economic but the main drawback is, it can not protect the system from travelling wave which may reach to the sub-station via different feeders.</p>
<h4 id="Overhead-Earth-Wire">Overhead Earth Wire</h4>
<p>This method of over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> protection is similar as earthing screen. The only difference is, an earthing screen is placed over an <a href="../electrical-power-substation-engineering-and-layout/index.html"  >electrical sub-station</a>, whereas, overhead earthwire is placed over <a href="../electrical-power-transmission-system-and-network/index.html"  >electrical transmission network</a>. One or two stranded GI wires of suitable cross-section are placed over the transmission conductors. These GI wires are properly grounded at each <a href="../basic-concept-of-transmission-tower-foundation/index.html"  >transmission tower</a>. These overhead ground wires or earthwire divert all the lightning strokes to the ground instead of allowing them to strike directly on the transmission conductors.</p>
<h4 id="Lightning-Arrester">Lightning Arrester</h4>
<p>The previously discussed two methods, i.e. earthing screen and over-head earth wire are very suitable for protecting an electrical power system from directed lightning strokes but system from directed lightning strokes but these methods can not provide any protection against high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> travelling wave which may propagate through the line to the equipment of the sub-station.</p>
<p>The lightning arrester is a devices which provides very low impedance path to the ground for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> travelling waves.</p>
<p>The concept of a lightning arrester is very simple. This device behaves like a nonlinear electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. The <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> decreases as <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> increases and vice-versa, after a certain level of voltage.</p>
<p>The functions of a lightning arrester or surge dividers can be listed as below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Under normal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level, these devices withstand easily the system <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> as <a href="../electrical-insulator-insulating-material-porcelain-glass-polymer-insulator/index.html"  >electrical insulator</a> and provide no conducting path to the system current.</li>
<li>On occurrence of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> surge in the system, these devices provide very low impedance path for the excess charge of the surge to the ground.</li>
<li>After conducting the charges of surge, to the ground, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> becomes to its normal level. Then lightning arrester regains its insulation properly and prevents regains its insulation property and prevents further conduction of current, to the ground.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are different types of lightning arresters used in power system, such as rod gap arrester, horn gap arrester, multi-gap arrester, expulsion type LA, value type LA.</p>
<p>In addition to these the most commonly used lightning arrester for over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> protection now-a-days gapless ZnO lightning arrester is also used.</p>
