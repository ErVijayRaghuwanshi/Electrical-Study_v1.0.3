</div>
<p>Today almost every electronic device needs a dc supply for its smooth operation and they need to be operated within certain power supply limits. This required dc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or dc supply is derived from single phase ac mains. A <strong>regulated power supply</strong> can convert unregulated an ac (alternating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or voltage) to a constant dc (direct  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or voltage). A <strong>regulated power supply</strong> is used to ensure that the output remains constant even if the input changes. A regulated DC power supply is also called as a linear power supply, it is an embedded circuit and consists of various blocks. The regulated power supply will accept an ac input and give a constant dc output. Figure below shows the block diagram of a typical regulated dc power supply.<br />
 <img src="../images/rps-1-12-01-14.gif" alt="block diagram of regulated power supply" width="582" height="296" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10281" /></p>
<p>The basic building blocks of a regulated dc power supply are as follows:</p>
<p>1. A step down transformer<br />
2. A rectifier<br />
3. A DC filter<br />
4. A regulator</p>
<h2 id="Operation-of-Regulated-Power-Supply">Operation of Regulated Power Supply</h2>
<h3 id="Step-Down-Transformer">Step Down Transformer</h3>
<p>A step down transformer will step down the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> from the ac mains to the required <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level. The turn’s ratio of the transformer is so adjusted such as to obtain the required <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> value. The output of the transformer is given as an input to the rectifier circuit.</p>
<h3 id="Rectification">Rectification</h3>
<p>Rectifier is an electronic circuit consisting of diodes which carries out the rectification process. Rectification is the process of converting an alternating <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  into corresponding direct (dc) quantity. The input to a rectifier is ac whereas its output is unidirectional pulsating dc. Usually a full wave rectifier or a bridge rectifier is used to rectify both the half cycles of the ac supply (full wave rectification). Figure below shows a <a href="../full-wave-diode-rectifier/index.html"  >full wave bridge rectifier</a>.<br />
 <img src="../images/rps-2-12-01-14.gif" alt="full wave bridge rectifier" width="503" height="315" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10282" /><br />
A bridge rectifier consists of four p-n junction diodes connected in the above shown manner. In the positive half cycle of the supply the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> induced across the secondary of the <a href="../what-is-transformer-definition-working-principle-of-transformer/index.html"  >electrical transformer</a> i.e. VMN is positive. Therefore point E is positive with respect to F. Hence, diodes D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> are reversed biased and diodes D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> are forward biased. The <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> D<sub>3</sub>  and D<sub>2</sub>  will act as open switches (practically there is some <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop) and diodes D<sub>1</sub> andD<sub>4</sub> will act as closed switches and will start conducting. Hence a rectified waveform appears at the output of the rectifier as shown in the first figure. When <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> induced in secondary i.e. VMN is negative than D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> are forward biased with the other two reversed biased and a positive <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> appears at the input of the filter.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="DC-Filteration">DC Filteration</h3>
<p>The rectified <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> from the rectifier is a pulsating dc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> having very high ripple content. But this is not we want, we want a pure ripple free dc waveform. Hence a filter is used. Different types of filters are used such as <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> filter, LC filter, Choke input filter, π type filter. Figure below shows a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> filter connected along the output of the rectifier and the resultant output waveform.<br />
 <img src="../images/rps-3-12-01-14.gif" alt="dc filter with output waveform" width="466" height="355" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10283" /><br />
As the instantaneous <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> starts increasing the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> charges, it charges till the waveform reaches its peak value. When the instantaneous value starts reducing the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> starts discharging exponentially and slowly through the load (input of the regulator in this case). Hence, an almost constant dc value having very less ripple content is obtained.</p>
<h3 id="Regulation">Regulation</h3>
<p>This is the last block in a regulated DC power supply. The output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will change or fluctuate when there is change in the input from ac mains or due to change in load current  at the output of the regulated power supply or due to other factors like temperature changes. This problem can be eliminated by using a regulator. A regulator will maintain the output constant even when changes at the input or any other changes occur. Transistor series regulator, Fixed and variable IC regulators or a zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> operated in the zener region can be used depending on their applications. IC’s like 78XX and 79XX are used to obtained fixed values of voltages at the output. With IC’s like LM 317 and 723 etc we can adjust the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to a required constant value. Figure below shows the LM317 <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulator. The output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> can be adjusted with adjusting the values of resistances R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>. Usually coupling  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> of values about 0.01µF to 10µF needs to be connected at the output and input to address input noise and output transients. Ideally the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is given by</p>
