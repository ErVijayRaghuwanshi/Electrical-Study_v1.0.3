<h2 id="Superposition-Theorem">Superposition Theorem</h2>
<p>This theorem is a very simple one. Suppose a branch of an electrical circuit is connected to numbers of <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" >voltage and <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> s</a>. As we can consider electrical  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  as electrical quantity, it can be easily assumed that total  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through the branch is nothing but the summation of all individual currents, contributed by the each individual <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" >voltage or <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> </a>. This simple conception mathematically represents the <strong>Superposition theorem</strong>.</p>
<p>If there are several sources acting simultaneously in an electrical circuit, then the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through any branch of the circuit is summation of currents which would flow through the branch for each source keeping all other sources dead. Suppose there are n number of sources acting in a circuit due to which I  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through a particular branch of the circuit. If someone replaces all the sources from the circuit by their internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> except first source which is now acting along in the circuit and giving  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>1</sub> through the said branch, then he or she reconnects the second source and replaces the first source by its internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. Now the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through that said branch for this second source alone can be assumed I<sub>2</sub>. Similarly if he or she reconnects the third source and replaces the second source by its internal resistance. Now the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through that said branch for this third source, alone is assumed I<sub>3</sub>. Similarly when n<sup>th</sup> source acts alone in the circuit and all other sources are replaced by their internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a>s, then said I<sub>n</sub>  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through the said branch of the circuit. Now according to <strong>Superposition theorem</strong>,  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the branch when all the sources are acting on the circuit simultaneously, is nothing but summation of these individual  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  caused by individual sources acting alone on the circuit.</p>

Electrical sources may be of two kinds mainly, one is <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" >voltage source</a> and other is <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> . When we remove the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" >voltage source</a> from a circuit, the voltage, was contributed to the circuit becomes zero. So for getting zero <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >electric potential difference</a> between the points where the removed <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  was connected, these two points must be short circuited by zero <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> path. For more accuracy, one can replace the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  by its internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. Now if we remove a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  from the circuit,  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is contributed by this source will become zero. Zero  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  implies open circuit. So when we remove <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  from a circuit, we just disconnect the source from the circuit terminals and keep both terminals open circuited. As the ideal internal resistance of a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  is infinitely large, removing a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  from a circuit can be alternatively referred as replacing the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  by its internal resistance. So for superposition theorem, the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> s are replaced by short circuits and <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> s are replaced by open circuits.</p>
<p>This theorem is only applicable to linear circuit i.e. circuit consisting of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s in which <a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html" title="Ohm’s Law">Ohm’s law</a>  is valid. In the circuits having non - linear <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s such as thermionic valves, metallic rectifiers this theorem will not be applicable. This theorem is a more laborious one than many other circuit theorems. But main advantage of this method is that, it avoids solutions of two or more simultaneous equations. But after a little practice with this method, equations can be written directly from the original circuit diagram and labor in drawing extra diagrams can be saved. For better understanding of the procedure, we have furnished the different steps of Superposition theorem as follows,</p>
<h4>Step - 1</h4>
<p>Replace all but one of the sources by their internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s.</p>
<h4>Step - 2</h4>
<p>Determine the currents in various branches using simple <a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html" title="Ohm’s Law">Ohm’s law</a> . </p>
<h4>Step - 3</h4>
<p>Repeat the process using each of the sources turn - by turn as the sole source each time.</p>
<h4>Step - 4</h4>
<p>Add all the currents in a particular branch due to each source. This is the desired value of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  at that branch when all the sources acting on the circuit simultaneously. </p>
<h4 id="Example-of-Superposition-Theorem">Example of Superposition Theorem</h4>
<p>Suppose there are two <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> s V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> acting simultaneously on the circuit.<br />
Because of these two <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" >voltage sources</a>, say  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I flows through the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R.<br />
<a href="../superposition-theorem/superposition-1/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-285"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/superposition-1.png" alt="Superposition Theorem" width="792" height="220" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-285" /></a></p>
<p>Now replace V<sub>2</sub> by short circuit, keeping V<sub>1</sub> at its position and measure  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, R. Say it is I<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>Then replace, V<sub>1</sub> by short circuit, reconnect V<sub>2</sub> to its original position and measure  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the same <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R and say it is I<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Now if we add these two currents, I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> we will get the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  which is equal to the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  - was actually flowing through R, when both <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> s V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> were acting on the circuit simultaneously. That is I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> = I.</p>
