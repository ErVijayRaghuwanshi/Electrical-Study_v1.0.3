<h2 id="History-of-Megger">History of Megger</h2>
<p>The device is being used since 1889, popularity raised during 1920s, since long back devise is same in its uses &#038; purpose of testing, few real improvement appeared in  recent years with its design &#038;  quality of tester. Now high quality option are available which are easy to use and quite safe.     </p>
<h2 id="What-is-Megger?">What is Megger?</h2>
<p>Insulation <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> quality of an electrical system degrades with time, environment condition i.e. temperature, humidity, moisture &#038; dust particles. It also get impacted negatively due to the presence of electrical &#038; mechanical stress, so it’s become very necessary to check the IR (Insulation <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a>) of equipment at a constant regular interval to avoid any measure fatal or electrical shock.<br />

<h2 id="Uses-of-Megger">Uses of Megger</h2>
<p>The device enable us to measure electrical leakage in wire, results are very reliable as we shall be passing <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html"  >electric current</a> through device while we are testing. The equipment basically use for verifying the electrical insulation level of any device such as motor, cable, generator winding, etc. This is a very poplar test being carried out since very long back. Not necessary it shows us exact area of electrical puncture but shows the amount of leakage  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  &#038; level of moisture within electrical equipment/winding/system.</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Megger">Types of Megger</h2>
<p>This can be separated into mainly two categories:-<br />
1.	Electronic Type ( <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">Battery</a>  Operated)<br />
2.	Manual Type (Hand Operated)<br />
But there are another types of <strong>megger</strong> which is motor operated type which does not use <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html"  >battery</a> to produce <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a> it requires external source to rotate a electrical motor which in turn rotates the generator of the <strong>megger</strong><br />

1)	<strong>Deflecting &#038; Control coil</strong> : Connected parallel to the generator, mounted at right angle to each other and maintain polarities in such a way to produced torque in opposite direction.</p>
<p>2)	<strong>Permanent Magnets</strong>: Produce <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html"  ><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> to deflect pointer with North-South pole magnet.</p>
<p>3)	<strong>Pointer</strong> : One end of the pointer connected with coil another end deflects on scale from infinity to zero.</p>
<p>4)	<strong>Scale</strong> : A scale is provided in front-top of the <a href="../megger-working-principle-types-history-uses-of-megger/index.html" title="Megger">megger</a> from range ‘zero’ to ‘infinity’, enable us to read the value.</p>
<p>5)	<strong>D.C generator or  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">Battery</a>  connection</strong> :	Testing <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is produced  by hand operated <a href="../principle-of-dc-generator/index.html"  >D.C generator</a> for manual operated Megger. <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html"  > <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">Battery</a> </a> / electronic <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> charger is provided for automatic type Megger for same purpose.</p>
<p>6)	<strong>Pressure coil resistance and Current coil resistance</strong> : Protect instrument from any damage because of low external <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html"  >electrical resistance</a> under test. </p>
<h2 id="Working-Principle-of-Megger">Working Principle of Megger</h2>
<p>•	Voltage for testing produced by hand operated <a href="../megger-working-principle-types-history-uses-of-megger/index.html" title="Megger">megger</a> by rotation of crank in case of hand operated type, a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is used for electronic tester. </p>
<p>•	500 Volt DC is sufficient for performing test on equipment range up to 440 Volts.</p>
<p>•	1000V to 5000V is used for testing for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> electrical systems.</p>
<p>•	Deflecting coil or  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  coil connected in series and allows flowing the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html"  >electric current</a> taken by the circuit being tested.</p>
<p>•	The control coil also known as pressure coil is connected across the circuit.</p>
<p>•	Current limiting <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>  (CCR &#038; PCR ) connected in series with control &#038; deflecting coil to protect damage in case of very low <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in external circuit.</p>
<p>•	In hand operated <a href="../megger-working-principle-types-history-uses-of-megger/index.html" title="Megger">megger</a> electromagnetic induction effect is used to produce the test <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a> i.e. armature arranges to move in permanent <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> or vice versa.</p>
<p>•	Where as in electronic type <a href="../megger-working-principle-types-history-uses-of-megger/index.html" title="Megger">megger</a>  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are used to produce the testing voltage.</p>
<p>•	As the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> increases in external circuit the deflection of pointer increases and deflection of pointer decreases with a increases of current. </p>
<p>•	Hence, resultant torque is directly proportional to <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> &#038; inversely proportional to current.</p>
<p>•	When electrical circuit being tested is open, torque due to <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> coil will be maximum  &#038; pointer shows ‘infinity’ means no shorting throughout the circuit and has maximum <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> within the circuit under test.</p>
<p>•	If there is short circuit pointer shows ‘zero’, which means ‘NO’ <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> within circuit being tested.  </p>
<p>Work philosophy based on ohm-meter or ratio-meter. The deflection torque is produced with <a href="../megger-working-principle-types-history-uses-of-megger/index.html" title="Megger">megger</a> tester due to the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> produced by <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> &#038; current, similarly like ‘<a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html"  >Ohm's Law</a>’</p>
<p>Torque of the <a href="../megger-working-principle-types-history-uses-of-megger/index.html" title="Megger">megger</a> varies in ration with V/I, (Ohm's Law :- V=IR or  R=V/I). <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html"  >Electrical resistance</a> to be measured is connected across the generator &#038; in series with deflecting coil.</p>
<p>Produced torque shall be in opposite direction if  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  supplied to the coil.</p>
<p>1.       High <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> = No  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  :- No  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  shall flow through deflecting coil,  if <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is very high i.e. infinity position of pointer</p>
<p>2.       Small <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> = High  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  :- If  circuit measures small  <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> allows a high <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html"  >electric current</a> to pass through  deflecting coil, i.e. produced  torque make the pointer to set at ‘ZERO’.</p>
<p>3.      Intermediate <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> = varied  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  :- If measured <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is intermediate, produced torque align or set the pointer between the range of ‘ZERO to INIFINITY’<br />
