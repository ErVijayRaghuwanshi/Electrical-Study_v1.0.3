<h2 id="Earth-Leakage-Circuit-Breaker-or-ELCB">Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker or ELCB</h2>
<p>If any <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a> leaks from any electrical installation, there must-be any insulation failure in the electrical circuit, it must be properly detected and prevented otherwise there may be a high chance of electrical shock if-anyone touches the installation. An <strong>earth leakage circuit breaker</strong> does it efficiently. Means it detects the earth leakage <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electrical current?">current</a> and makes the power supply off by opening the associated circuit breaker. There are two types of <strong>earth leakage circuit breaker</strong>, one is <strong>voltage ELCB</strong> and other is <strong>current ELCB</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Voltage-ELCB">Voltage Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker</h3>
<p>The <strong>working principle of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ELCB</strong> is quite simple. One terminal of the relay coil is connected to the metal body of the equipment to be protected against earth leakage and other terminal is connected to the earth directly. If any insulation failure occurs or live phase wire touches the metal body, of the equipment, there must be a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> difference appears across the terminal of the coil connected to the equipment body and earth. This <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> difference produces a <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is Electric current?">current</a> to flow the relay coil.<div id="attachment_15696" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 563px"><img src="../images/voltage-rccb.gif" alt="voltage earth leakage circuit breaker" width="553" height="373" class="size-full wp-image-15696" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Voltage Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker</p></div> If the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> difference crosses, a predetermined limit, the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is Electric current?">current</a> through the relay becomes sufficient to actuate the relay for tripping the associated circuit breaker to disconnect the power supply to the equipment. The typicality of this device is, it can detect and protect only that equipment or installation with which it is attached. It cannot detect any leakage of insulation in other installation of the system.</p>

<h3 id="Current-ELCB-or-RCCB-or-Residual-Current-Circuit-Breaker"> <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">Current</a> ELCB or RCCB or Residual <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is Electrical current?">Current</a> Circuit Breaker</h3>
<p>The <strong>working principle of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is Electric current?">current</a> earth leakage circuit breaker</strong> or <strong>RCCB</strong> is also very simple as <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> operated ELCB but the theory is entirely different and <strong>residual <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="what is electric current?">current</a> circuit breaker</strong> is more sensitive than ELCB. Actually, ELCBs are of two kinds, but it is general practice to refer <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> based ELCB as simple ELCB. And <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a> based ELCB is referred as RCD or RCCB. Here one CT core is energized from both phase wise and neutral wire.<div id="attachment_15688" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 471px"><img src="../images/RCCB-1-Phase.gif" alt="residual <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?"><p class="wp-caption-text">current</a> circuit breaker" width="461" height="348" class="size-full wp-image-15688" /> Single Phase Residual <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">Current</a> Circuit Breaker or <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">Current</a> ELCB</p></div> The polarity of the phase winding and neutral winding on the core is so chosen that, in normal condition mmf of one winding opposes that of another. As it is assumed that, in normal operating conditions the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a> goes through the phase wire will be returned via neutral wire if there's no leakage in between. As both <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a>s are same, the resultant mmf produced by these two <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a>s is also zero-ideally. The relay coil is connected with another third winding wound on the CT core as secondary. The terminals of this winding are connected to a relay system. In normal operating condition there would not be any <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a> circulating in the third winding as here is no flux in the core due to equal phase and neutral <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a>. When any earth leakage occurs in the equipment, there may be part of phase <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a> passes to the earth, through the leakage path instead of returning via mental wire. Hence the magnitude of the neutral current passing through the RCCB is not equal to phase <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is Electric current?">current</a> passing through it.<div id="attachment_15692" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 541px"><img src="../images/RCCB-3-Phase.gif" alt="three phase residual <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?"><p class="wp-caption-text">current</a> circuit breaker or current elcb" width="531" height="370" class="size-full wp-image-15692" /> Three Phase Residual Current Circuit Breaker or Current ELCB</p></div> When this difference crosses a predetermined value, the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a> in the third secondary winding of the core becomes sufficiently high to actuate the electromagnetic relay attached to it. This relay causes tripping of the associated circuit breaker to disconnect the power supply to the equipment under protection. <strong>Residual <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a> circuit breaker</strong> is sometimes also referred as residual <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/#what-is-electric-current" title="What is electric current?">current</a> device (RCD) when we consider the device by disassociating the circuit breaker attached to <strong>RCCB</strong>. That means, the entire parts of RCCB except circuit breaker are referred as RCD.</p>
