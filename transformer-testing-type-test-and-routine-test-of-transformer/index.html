<p>For confirming the specifications and performances of an <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a> it has to go through numbers of testing procedures. Some tests are done at manufacturer premises before delivering the transformer. Mainly two types of <strong>transformer testing</strong> are done at manufacturer premises-<strong> type test of transformer</strong> and <strong> routine test of transformer</strong>. In addition to that some <strong> transformer tests</strong> are also carried out at the consumer site before commissioning and also periodically in regular &amp; emergency basis through out its service life.</p>

<h2 id="Type-Test-of-Transformer">Type Test of Transformer</h2>
<p>To prove that the transformer meets customerâ€™s specifications and design expectations, the transformer has to go through different testing procedures in manufacturer premises. Some <strong>transformer tests</strong> are carried out for confirming the basic design expectation of that transformer. These tests are done mainly in a prototype unit not in all manufactured units in a lot.  <strong>Type test of transformer</strong> confirms main and basic design criteria of a production lot.</p>
<h2 id="Routine-Tests-of-Transformer">Routine Tests of Transformer</h2>
<p><strong>Routine tests of transformer</strong> is mainly for confirming operational performance of individual unit in a production lot. Routine tests are carried out on every unit manufactured.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Special-Tests-of-Transformer">Special Tests of Transformer</h2>
<p><strong>Special tests of transformer</strong> is done as per customer requirement to obtain information useful to the user during operation or maintenance of the transformer.</p>
<h3 id="Pre-Commissioning-Test-of-Transformer"> Pre Commissioning Test of Transformer</h3>
<p>In addition to these, the transformer also goes through some other tests, performed on it, before actual commissioning of the transformer at site. The <strong>transformer testing</strong> performed before commissioning the transformer at site is called pre-commissioning test of transformer. These tests are done to assess the condition of transformer after installation and compare the test results of all the low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> tests with the factory test reports.</p>

<p><a href="../transformer-winding-resistance-measurement/index.html" >Transformer winding resistance measurement</a> is carried out to calculate the I<sup>2</sup>R losses and to calculate winding temperature at the end of a temperature rise test. It is carried out as a type test as well as routine test.

<h2 id="Transformer-Ratio-Test">Transformer Ratio Test</h2>
<p>The performance of a transformer largely depends upon perfection of specific turns or <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ratio of transformer. So transformer ratio test is an essential <strong>type test of transformer</strong>. This test also performed as <strong>routine test of transformer</strong>. So for ensuring proper performance of <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> transformer, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and turn ratio test of transformer one of the vital tests.</p>
<p>The procedure of transformer ratio test is simple. We just apply three phase 415 V supply to HV winding, with keeping LV winding open. The we measure the induced voltages at HV and LV terminals of transformer to find out actual <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ratio of transformer. We repeat the test for all tap position separately.</p>
<h2 id="Magnetic-Balance-Test-of-Transformer">Magnetic Balance Test of Transformer</h2>
<p>Magnetic balance test of transformer is conducted only on three phase transformers to check the imbalance in the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Circuit" title="Magnetic Circuit ">magnetic circuit</a>. </p>
<h4 id="Procedure-of-Magnetic-Balance-Test-of-Transformer">Procedure of Magnetic Balance Test of Transformer</h4>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>First keep the tap changer of transformer in normal position.</li>
<li>Now disconnect the transformer neutral from ground.</li>
<li>Then apply single phase 230 V AC supply across one of the HV winding terminals and neutral terminal.</li>
<li>Measure the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in two other HV terminals in respect of neutral terminal.</li>
<li>Repeat the test for each of the three phases. </li>
</ol>
<p>In case of auto transformer, magnetic balance test of transformer should be repeated for LV winding also.</p>
<p>There are three limbs side by side in a core of transformer. One phase winding is wound in one limb. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> induced in different phases depends upon the respective position of the limb in the core. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> induced in different phases of transformer in respect to neutral terminals given in the table below. </p>

<h2 id="Magnetizing-Current-Test-of-Transformer">Magnetizing Current Test of Transformer</h2>
<p><strong>Magnetizing  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  test of transformer</strong> is performed to locate defects in the magnetic core structure, shifting of windings, failure in turn to turn insulation or problem in tap changers. These conditions change the effective reluctance of the magnetic circuit, thus affecting the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> required to establish flux in the core. </p>
<ol>
<li>First of all keep the tap changer in the lowest position and open all IV &amp; LV terminals.</li>
<li>Then apply three phase 415 V supply on the line terminals for three phase transformers and single phase 230 V supply on single phase transformers.</li>
<li>Measure the supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> in each phase.</li>
<li>Now repeat the <strong>magnetizing  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  test of transformer</strong>test with keeping tap changer in normal position.</li>
<li>And repeat the test with keeping the tap at highest position.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally there are two similar higher readings on two outer limb phases on transformer core and one lower reading on the centre limb phase, in case of three phase transformers. An agreement to within 30% of the measured exciting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  with the previous test is usually considered satisfactory. If the measured exciting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  value is 50 times higher than the value measured during factory test, there is likelihood of a fault in the winding which needs further analysis.</p>
<p><span class="Green"> Caution: This <strong>magnetizing  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  test of transformer</strong> is to be carried out before DC <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> measurement.</span></p>
<h2 id="Vector-Group-Test-of-Transformer">Vector Group Test of Transformer</h2>
<p>In <a href="../single-three-phase-transformer-vs-bank-of-three-single-phase-transformers/index.html" >three phase transformer</a>, it is essential to carry out a vector group test of transformer. Proper vector grouping in a transformer is an essential criteria for <a href="../parallel-operation-of-transformers/index.html" >parallel operation of transformers</a>.</p>
<p>There are several internal connection of <a href="../single-three-phase-transformer-vs-bank-of-three-single-phase-transformers/index.html" >three phase transformer</a> are available in market. These several connections gives various magnitudes and phase of the secondary voltage; the magnitude can be adjusted for parallel operation by suitable choice of turn ratio, but the phase divergence can not be compensated. So we have to choose those transformer for parallel operation whose phase sequence and phase divergence are same. All the transformers with same vector ground have same phase sequence and phase divergence between primary and secondary. So before procuring one <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a>, one should ensure the vector group of the transformer, whether it will be matched with his or her existing system or not. The vector group test of transformer confirms his or her requirements. </p>
