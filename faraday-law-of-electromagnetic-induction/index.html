<p>In 1831, Michael Faraday, an English physicist gave one of the most basic laws of electromagnetism called <strong>Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction</strong>. This law explains the working principle of most of the<a href="../electrical-motor-types-classification-and-history-of-motor/index.html"  >electrical motors</a>, generators, <a href="../what-is-transformer-definition-working-principle-of-transformer/index.html"  >electrical transformers</a> and <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductors</a> . This law shows the relationship between electric circuit and <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>. Faraday performs an experiment with a magnet and coil. During this experiment, he found how emf is induced in the coil when flux linked with it changes. He has also done experiments in electro-chemistry and electrolysis.</p>

In this experiment, Faraday takes a magnet and a coil and connects a galvanometer across the coil. At starting, the magnet is at rest, so there is no deflection in the galvanometer i.e needle of galvanometer is at the center or zero position. When the magnet is moved towards the coil, the needle of galvanometer deflects in one direction. When the magnet is held stationary at that position, the needle of galvanometer returns back to zero position. Now when the magnet is moved away from the coil, there is some deflection in the needle but in opposite direction and again when the  magnet becomes stationary, at that point with respect to coil, the needle of the  galvanometer returns back to the zero position. Similarly, if magnet is held stationary and the coil is moved away and towards the magnet, the galvanometer shows deflection in similar manner. It is also seen that, the faster the change in the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>, the greater will be the induced emf or <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in the coil.</p>

<p>< class="Green">CONCLUSION: From this experiment, Faraday concluded that whenever there is relative motion between conductor and a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>, the flux linkage with a coil changes and this change in flux induces a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across a coil.</p>
<p>Michael Faraday formulated two laws on the basis of above experiments. These laws are called <strong>Faraday's laws of electromagnetic induction</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Faraday's-Laws">Faraday's Laws</h2>
<h3 id="Faraday's-First-Law">Faraday's First Law</h3>
<p>Any change in the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> of a coil of wire will cause an emf to be induced in the coil. This emf induced is called induced emf and if the conductor circuit is closed, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will also circulate through the circuit and this  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is called induced current.<br />
Method to change <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>:<br />
1.	By moving a magnet towards or away from the coil</p>
<p>2.	By moving the coil into or out of the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>.</p>
<p>3.	By changing the area of a coil placed in the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a></p>
<p>4.	By rotating the coil relative to the magnet.</p>
<h3 id="Faraday's-Second-Law">Faraday's Second Law</h3>
<p>It states that the magnitude of emf induced in the coil is equal to the rate of change of flux that linkages with the coil. The flux linkage of the coil is the product of number of turns in the coil and flux associated with the coil.</p>
<h2 id="Faraday-Law-Formula">Faraday Law Formula</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_4608" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 360px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/faraday-law-1.jpg"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/faraday-law-1.jpg" alt="Faraday&#039;s law " width="350" height="253" class="size-full wp-image-4608" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Faraday's law</p></div><br />
Consider a magnet approaching towards a coil. Here we consider two instants at time T<sub>1</sub> and time T<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Flux linkage with the coil at time, T<sub>1</sub> = NΦ<sub>1</sub>   Wb</p>
<p>Flux linkage with the coil at time, T<sub>2</sub> = NΦ<sub>2</sub> wb</p>
<p>Change in flux linkage = N(Φ<sub>2</sub> - Φ<sub>1</sub>)</p>
<p>Let this change in flux linkage be, Φ = Φ<sub>2</sub> - Φ<sub>1</sub>  </p>
<p>So, the Change in flux linkage = NΦ</p>
<p>Now the rate of change of flux linkage = NΦ / t</p>
<p>Take derivative on right hand side we will get</p>
<p>The rate of change of flux linkage = NdΦ/dt</p>
<p>But according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, the rate of change of flux linkage is equal to induced emf.<br />

Where flux Φ in Wb = B.A </p>
<p>B = <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> strength</p>
<p>A = area of the coil<br />
<b>HOW TO INCREASE EMF INDUCED IN A COIL</b></p>
<p>•	By increasing the number of turns in the coil i.e N- From the formulae derived above it is easily seen that if number of turns of coil is increased, the induced emf also gets increased.</p>
<p>•	By increasing <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> strength i.e B surrounding the coil- Mathematically if <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> increases, flux increases and if flux increases emf induced will also get increased. Theoretically, if the coil is passed through a stronger <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>, there will be more lines of force for coil to cut and hence there will be more emf induced.</p>
<p>•	By increasing the speed of the relative motion between the coil and the magnet - If the relative speed between the coil and magnet is increased from its previous value, the coil will cut the lines of flux at a faster rate, so more induced emf would be produced.</p>
<h2 id="Applications-of-Faraday-Law">Applications of Faraday Law</h2>
<p>Faraday law is one of the most basic and important laws of electromagnetism . This law finds its application in most of the electrical machines, industries and medical field etc.</p>
<p>•	<a href="../what-is-transformer-definition-working-principle-of-transformer/index.html"  >Electrical Transformers</a><br />
It is a static ac device which is used to either step up or step down <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or current. It is used in generating station, transmission and distribution system. The transformer works on Faraday's law.</p>
<p>•	Electrical Generators<br />
The basic working principle of electrical generator is Faraday's law of mutual induction. Electric generator is used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. </p>
<p>•	Induction Cookers<br />
The Induction cooker, is a most fastest way of cooking. It also works on principle of mutual induction. When  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through the coil of copper wire placed below a cooking container, it produces a changing <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>. This alternating or changing <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> induces an emf and hence the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the conductive container, and we know that flow of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  always produces heat in it. </p>
<p>•	Electromagnetic Flow Meters<br />
It is used to measure velocity of blood and certain fluids. When a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> is applied to electrically insulated pipe in which conducting fluids are flowing, then according to Faraday's law, an electromotive force is induced in it. This induced emf is proportional to velocity of fluid flowing .</p>
<p>•	Form the bases of Electromagnetic Theory<br />
Faraday's idea of lines of force is used in well known Maxwell's equations. According to Faraday's law, change in <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> gives rise to change in electric field and the converse of this is used in Maxwell's equations.</p>
<p>•	 Musical Instruments<br />
It is also used in musical instruments like electric guitar, electric violin etc.</p>
