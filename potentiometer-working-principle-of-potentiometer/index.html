<div>This is a very basic instrument used for comparing emf two cells and for calibrating ammeter, voltmeter and watt-meter. The basic <strong>working principle of potentiometer</strong> is very very simple.</div>
<div>Suppose we have connected two  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  in head to head and tale to tale through a galvanometer. That means the positive terminals of both  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are connected together and negative terminals are also connected together through a galvanometer as shown in the figure below. </div>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/potentiometer-principle1.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/potentiometer-principle1.png" alt="potentiometer principle" width="336" height="280" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3615" /></a>
<div>Here in the figure it is clear that if the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of both  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  cells is exactly equal, there will be no circulating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the circuit and hence the galvanometer shows null deflection. The <strong>working principle of potentiometer</strong> depends upon this phenomenon.</div>
<div>Now let's think about another circuit, where a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is connected across a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> via a switch and a rheostat as shown in the figure below, there will be a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. As there is a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage</a> drop across the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>, this portion of the circuit can be considered as a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  for other external circuits. That means anything connected across the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> will get voltage. If the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> has uniform cross section throughout its length, the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> per unit length of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is also uniform throughout its length. Hence, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop per unit length of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is also uniform. Suppose the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> through the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is i A and <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> per unit length of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is r &Omega;. Then the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> appears per unit length across the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> would be 'ir' ans say it is v volt.</div>
<div>Now, positive terminal of a standard cell is connected to point A on the sliding <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> and negative terminal of the same is connected with a galvanometer. Other end of the galvanometer is in contact with the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> via a sliding contact as shown in the figure above. By adjusting this sliding end, a point like B is found where, there is no  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the galvanometer, hence no deflection of galvanometer. That means emf of the standard cell is just balanced by the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop appears across AB. Now if the distance between point A and B is L, then it can be written emf of standard cell E = Lv volt. As v (voltage drop per unit length of the sliding <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>) is known and L is measured from the scale attached to the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>, the value of E i.e. emf of standard cell can also be calculated from the above simple equation very easily.</div>
<p><div id="attachment_3628" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 748px"><a href="../potentiometer-working-principle-of-potentiometer/dc-potentiometer/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-3628"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dc-potentiometer.png" alt="Basic DC Potentiometer" width="738" height="422" class="size-full wp-image-3628" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Basic DC Potentiometer</p></div>
<div>We said earlier in this section that one of the uses of potentiometer is to compare emfs of different cells. Let's discuss how a dc potentiometer can compare emfs of two different cells. Let's think of two cells whose emf's are to be compared are joined as shown in the figure below. The positive terminals of the cells and source  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are joined together. The negative terminals of the cells are joined with the galvanometer in turn through a two way switch. The other end of the galvanometer is connected to a sliding contact on the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. Now by adjusting sliding contact on the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>, it is found that the null deflection of galvanometer comes for first cell at a length of L on the scale and after positioning to way switch to second cell and then by adjusting the sliding contact, it is found that the null deflection of galvanometer comes for that cell at a length of L<sub>1</sub> on the scale.</div>
<div>Let's think of the first cell as standard cell and it's emf is E and second cell is unknown cell whose emf is E<sub>1</sub>. Now as per above explanation, <br/>E = Lv volt and<br/> L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>1</sub>v volt<br/> Dividing one equation by other, we get</div>
<p><img src='1.png' id="latex%5Cfrac%7BE_%7B1%7D%7D%7BE%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BL_%7B1%7D%7D%7BL%7D&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='\frac{E_{1}}{E} = \frac{L_{1}}{L}' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='\frac{E_{1}}{E} = \frac{L_{1}}{L}' />
<div>As the emf of the standard cell is known, hence emf of the unknown cell can easily be determined.</div>
