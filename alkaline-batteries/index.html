<p>  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">batteries</a>  have become one of the most important and most used equipments these days.   <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">batteries</a>  are used where power supply is not regular, where low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage</a> is required (i.e. lower than supply voltage); watches, mobiles and many other small equipments that require lesser voltage, mainly run on  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> . The main advantage of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are that, they can be charged and used if the capability of supplying power reduces. Cells are the unit of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> , many cells complete a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  .

The first <strong>Alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  </strong> was brought into market by Eveready  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">Battery</a> , Toronto. It was developed by Lew Urry who was attached to this company as a chemical engineer. </p>
<p>Lew Urry developed the small <strong>alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  </strong> in 1949. The inventor was working for the Eveready  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">Battery</a>  Co. at their research laboratory in Parma, Ohio. <strong>Alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> </strong> last five to eight times as long as zinc-carbon cells, their predecessors. </p></p>

Electrolysis basically means chemical reaction while conducting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through a mixture. Electrolysis is used not only for making  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> , but for various purposes also. These  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are introduced to overcome the weight and mechanical weakness of the lead plates. The main working <strong>principle of the alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> </strong> is  based on the reaction between zinc (Zn) and manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>). Alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is so named because the electrolyte used in it is potassium hydroxide, a purely alkaline substance.</p>

<h2 id="Construction-of-Alkaline-Battery">Construction of Alkaline Battery</h2>
<p>The body of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is made of a hollow steel drum. This drum contains all materials of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  and it also serves as cathode of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  . The positive terminal of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is projected from the top of this drum. Fine grained manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) powder mixed with coal dust is molted to the inner peripheral surface of the empty cylindrical drum. This molded mixture serves as cathode mixture of the alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  . The inner surface of the thick layer of cathode mixture is covered with paper separator. The central space, inside this paper separator is filled by zinc powder with potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The zinc serves as anode and its powder form increases the contact surface. The paper separator soaked with potassium hydroxide, holds the electrolyte in between cathode(MnO<sub>2</sub>) and anode(Zn). A metallic pin (preferably made of brass) is inserted along the central axis of the alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  to collect negative charge. This pin is called negative collector pin. This pin is in touch with metallic end sealed cap. There is a plastic cover just inside the Metallic end sealed cap and this plastic cover electrically separates positive steel drum and negative end cap of alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> .<br />

In an alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  cell, the powder zinc serves as anode, manganese dioxide serves as cathode and potassium hydroxide serves as electrolyte.</p>
<p>First half reaction is,<br />

Second half reaction is,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/abc-2.png" alt=" "/></center><br />
Overall reaction,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/abc-3.png" alt=" "/></center><br />
An alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  cell is rated for 1.5 V. A new non discharged alkaline cell shows a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of 1.50 to 1.65 V. The average <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> under load condition may be 1.1 to 1.3 V. AA alkaline cell is generally rated for 700 mA. </p>
<p>There are various <strong>types of alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> </strong> depending on various parameters.</p>
<p>Depending on the composition of the active materials of the plates, there are four types of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> . They are as follows, </p>
<ol>
<li>Nickel iron (or Edison).</li>
<li>Nickel- cadmium (or Nife).</li>
<li>Silver zinc.</li>
<li>Alkum  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> .</li>
<p>Depending on the method of assembling, these  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are classified as sealed and non-sealed cells or  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> .</p>
<p>Depending on the design plates, alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are classified as enclosed pocket and open pocket type  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> .<br />

<h3 id="Use-of-Alkaline-Batteries">Use of Alkaline Batteries</h3>
<p>Various types of these  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are there and different  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are used for different purposes. Like, nickel iron  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are used for propulsion of industrial trucks and mine locomotives. In air conditions also, this type of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are used. Another type of alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is Nickel-cadmium  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> , they get used in commercial airlines, military aeroplane for initiating main engine. So, we can say that the alkaline  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are mainly used in moving vehicles and industrial purposes.</p>
