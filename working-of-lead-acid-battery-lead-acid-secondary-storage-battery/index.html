The conversion of electrical energy into chemical energy by applying external electrical source is known as charging of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  . Whereas conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy for supplying the external load is known as discharging of secondary  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  .</p>
<p>During charging of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  ,  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> is passed through it which causes some chemical changes inside the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  . This chemical changes absorb energy during their formation. </p>
<p>When the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is connected to the external load, the chemical changes take place in reverse direction, during which the absorbed energy is released as electrical energy and supplied to the load.</p>
<p>Now we will try to understand principle <strong>working of  <a href="../working-of-lead-acid-battery-lead-acid-secondary-storage-battery/index.html" title="Working of Lead Acid Battery">lead acid  battery</a>   </strong> and for that we will first discuss about <strong> <a href="../working-of-lead-acid-battery-lead-acid-secondary-storage-battery/index.html" title="Working of Lead Acid Battery">lead acid  battery</a>   </strong> which is very commonly used as storage  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  or secondary  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  .</p>

<h2 id="Materials-used-for-Lead-Acid-Storage-Battery-Cells">Materials used for Lead Acid Storage Battery  Cells</h2>
<p>The main active materials required  to construct a lead-acid  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  are </p>
<ol>
<li>Lead peroxide (PbO<sub>2</sub>).</li>
<li>Sponge lead (Pb) and</li>
<li>Dilute sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Lead-Peroxide">Lead Peroxide (PbO<sub>2</sub>)</h4>
<p>The positive plate is made of lead peroxide. This is dark brown, hard and brittle substance.</p>
<h4 id="Sponge-Lead">Sponge Lead (Pb)</h4>
<p>The negative plate is made of pure lead in soft sponge condition. </p>
<h4 id="Dilute-Sulfuric-Acid">Dilute Sulfuric Acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)</h4>
<p>Dilute sulfuric acid used for  <a href="../working-of-lead-acid-battery-lead-acid-secondary-storage-battery/index.html" title="Working of Lead Acid Battery">lead acid  battery</a>   has ration of water : acid = 3:1.</p>
<p>The <strong>lead acid storage  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  </strong> is formed by dipping lead peroxide plate and sponge lead plate in dilute sulfuric acid. A load is connected externally between these plates. In diluted sulfuric acid the molecules of the acid split into positive hydrogen ions ( H<sup>+</sup>) and negative sulfate ions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup> &minus; &minus;</sup>). The hydrogen ions when reach at PbO<sub>2</sub> plate, they receive electrons from it and become hydrogen atom which again attack PbO<sub>2</sub> and form PbO and H<sub>2</sub>O (water). This PbO reacts with H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> and forms PbSO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O (water).<br />
<img src="../equations/lab1.gif" alt=""/></p>
<p>SO<sub>4</sub><sup> &minus; &minus;</sup> ions are moving freely in the solution so some of them will reach to pure Pb plate where they give their extra electrons and become radical SO<sub>4</sub>. As the radical SO<sub>4</sub> cannot exist alone it will attack Pb and will form PbSO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p>As H<sup>+</sup> ions take electrons from PbO<sub>2</sub> plate and SO<sub>4</sub><sup> &minus; &minus;</sup> ions give electrons to Pb plate, there would be an inequality of electrons between these two plates. Hence there would be a flow of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the external load between these plates for balancing this inequality of electrons. This process is called discharging of  <a href="../working-of-lead-acid-battery-lead-acid-secondary-storage-battery/index.html" title="Working of Lead Acid Battery">lead acid  battery</a>   .</p>
<p>The lead sulfate (PbSO<sub>4</sub>) is whitish in color. During discharging,</p>
<ol>
<li>Both of the plates are covered with PbSO<sub>4</sub>.</li>
<li>Specific gravity of sulfuric acid solution falls due to formation of water during reaction at PbO<sub>2</sub> plate.</li>
<li>As a result, the rate of reaction falls which implies the potential difference between the plates decreases during discharging process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we will disconnect the load and connect PbSO<sub>4</sub> covered PbO<sub>2</sub> plate with positive terminal of an external DC source and PbO<sub>2</sub> covered Pb plate with negative terminal of that DC source. During discharging, the density of sulfuric acid falls but there still sulfuric acid exists in the solution. This sulfuric acid also remains as H<sup>+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup> &minus; &minus;</sup> ions in the solution. Hydrogen ions (cation) being positively charged, move to the electrode (cathode) connected with negative terminal of the DC source. Here each  H<sup>+</sup> ion takes one electron from that and becomes hydrogen atom. These hydrogen atoms then attack PbSO<sub>4</sub> and form lead and sulfuric acid.<br />
<center><img src="../equations/wlab-01-22-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
 SO<sub>4</sub><sup> &minus; &minus;</sup> ions (anions) move towards the electrode (anode) connected with positive terminal of DC source where they will give up their extra electrons and become radical SO<sub>4</sub>. This radical SO<sub>4</sub> cannot exist alone hence reacts with PbSO<sub>4</sub> of anode and forms lead peroxide ( PbO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).<br />
<center><img src="../equations/wlab-02-22-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Hence by charging the lead acid storage  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  cell, </p>
<ol>
<li>Lead sulfate anode gets converted into lead peroxide.</li>
<li>Lead sulfate of cathode is converted to pure lead.</li>
<li>Terminal; potential of the cell increases.</li>
<li>Specific gravity of sulfuric acid increases.</li>
</ol>
