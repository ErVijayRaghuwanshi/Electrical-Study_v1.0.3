<p>The <a href="../single-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >single phase induction motors</a> are made self starting by providing an additional flux by some additional means. Now depending upon these additional means the <a href="../single-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >single phase induction motors</a> are classified as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Split phase induction motor</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Capacitor start <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  motor</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="Split-Phase-Induction-Motor">Split Phase Induction Motor</h2>
<p> In addition to the main winding or running winding, the stator of <a href="../single-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >single phase induction motor</a> carries another winding called auxiliary winding or starting winding. A centrifugal switch is connected in series with auxiliary winding . The purpose of this switch is to disconnect the auxiliary winding from the main circuit when the motor attains a speed up to 75 to 80% of the synchronous speed. We know that the running winding is inductive in nature. Our aim is to create the phase difference between the two winding and this is possible if the starting winding carries high <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. Let us say </p>
<p>I<sub>run</sub> is the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing through the main or running winding,</p>
<p>I<sub>start</sub> is the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing in starting winding,</p>
<p>&amp; V<sub>T</sub> is the supply voltage.<br />

We know that for highly resistive winding the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is almost in phase with the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and for highly inductive winding the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  lag behind the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by large angle. The starting winding is highly resistive so, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing in the starting winding lags behind the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by very small angle and the running winding is highly inductive in nature so, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing in running winding lags behind applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by large angle. The resultant of these two  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is I<sub>T</sub>. The resultant of these two  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  produce rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> which rotates in one direction. In <strong>split phase induction motor</strong> the starting and main  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  get splitted from each other by some angle so this motor got its name as split phase induction motor.</p>

<h3 id="Applications-of-Split-Phase-Induction-Motor">Applications of Split Phase Induction Motor</h3>
<p>Split phase induction motors have low starting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and moderate starting torque. So these motors are used in fans, blowers, centrifugal pumps, washing machine grinder etc. These motors are available in the size ranging from 1 / 20 to 1 / 2 KW.</p>

<p>The working principle and construction of Capacitor start <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  motors and <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> start <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> run induction motors are almost the same. We already know that <a href="../single-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >single phase induction motor</a> is not self starting because the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> produced is not rotating type. In order to produce rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> there must be some phase difference. In case of split phase <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> we use <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> for creating phase difference but here we use <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> for this purpose. We are familiar with this fact that the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing through the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> leads the voltage. So, in <strong>capacitor start <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  motor</strong> and <strong>capacitor start <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> run induction motor</strong> we are using two winding, the main winding and the starting winding. With starting winding we connect a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> so the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing in the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> i.e I<sub>st</sub> leads the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by some angle, &phi;<sub>st</sub>.</p>
<p>The running winding is inductive in nature so, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing in running winding lags behind applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by an angle, &phi;<sub>m</sub>. Now there occur large phase angle differences between these two currents which produce an resultant current, I and this will produce a rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>. Since the torque produced by these motors depends upon the phase angle difference, which is almost 90&deg;. So, these motors produce very high starting torque. In case of <strong>capacitor start induction motor</strong>, the centrifugal switch is provided so as to disconnect the starting winding when the motor attains a speed up to 75 to 80% of the synchronous speed but in case of <strong>capacitor start  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> run induction motor</strong> there is no centrifugal switch so, the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> remains in the circuit and helps to improve the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> and the running conditions of <a href="../single-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >single phase induction motor</a>.</p>

<p>These motors have high starting torque hence they are used in conveyors, grinder, air conditioners etc. They are available up to 6 KW.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_6735" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 638px"><a href="../single-phase-induction-motor/shaded-pole-single-phase-induction-motor/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-6735"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/08/shaded-pole-single-phase-induction-motor.gif" alt="Shaded Pole Single Phase Induction Motors" width="628" height="280" class="size-full wp-image-6735" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shaded Pole Single Phase Induction Motors</p></div><br />
The stator of the <strong>shaded pole single phase induction motor</strong> has salient or projected poles. These poles are shaded by copper band or ring which is inductive in nature. The poles are divided into two unequal halves. The smaller portion carries the copper band and is called as shaded portion of the pole.</p>
<p>ACTION: When a single phase supply is given to the stator of shaded pole <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> an alternating flux is produced . This change of flux induces emf in the shaded coil. Since this shaded portion is short circuited, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is produced in it in such a direction to oppose the main flux. The flux in shaded pole lags behind the flux in the unshaded pole. The phase difference between these two fluxes produces resultant rotating flux.</p>
<p>We know that the stator winding  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is alternating in nature and so is the flux produced by the stator current. In order to clearly understand the working of shaded pole <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> consider three regions-</p>
<ol>
<li>When the flux changes its value from  zero to nearly maximum positive value.</li>
<li>When the flux remains almost constant at its maximum value.</li>
<li>When the flux decreases from maximum positive value to zero.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>REGION 1:</b> When the flux changes its value from zero to nearly maximum positive value – In this region the rate of rise of flux and hence  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is very high. According to <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html" >Faraday's law</a> whenever there is change in flux emf gets induced. Since the copper band is short circuit the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  starts flowing in the copper band due to this induced emf. This  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in copper band produces its own flux. Now according to <a href="../lenz-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html" >Lenz's law</a> the direction of this  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in copper band is such that it opposes its own cause i.e rise in current. So the shaded ring flux opposes the main flux, which leads to the crowding of flux in non shaded part of stator and the flux weaken in shaded part. This non uniform distribution of flux causes magnetic axis to shift in the middle of the non shaded part.</p>
<p><b>REGION 2:</b> When the flux remains almost constant at its maximum value – In this region the rate of rise of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and hence flux remains almost constant. Hence there is very little induced emf in the shaded portion. The flux produced by this induced emf has no effect on the main flux and hence distribution of flux remains uniform and the magnetic axis lies at the center of the pole.</p>
<p><b>REGION 3:</b> When the flux decreases from maximum positive value to zero - In this region the rate of decrease in the flux and hence  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is very high. According to <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html" >Faraday's law</a> whenever there is change in flux emf gets induced. Since the copper band is short circuit the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  starts flowing in the copper band due to this induced emf. This  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in copper band produces its own flux. Now according to <a href="../lenz-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html" >Lenz's law</a> the direction of the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in copper band is such that it opposes its own cause i.e decrease in current. So the shaded ring flux aids the main flux, which leads to the crowding of flux in  shaded part of stator and the flux weaken in non shaded part. This non uniform distribution of flux causes magnetic axis to shift in the middle of the shaded part of the pole.</p>
<p>This shifting of magnetic axis continues for negative cycle also and leads to the production of rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>. The direction of this field is from non shaded part of the pole to the shaded part of the pole.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Shaded-Pole-Motor">Advantages and Disadvantages of Shaded Pole Motor</h3>
<p>The advantages of shaded pole <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> are</p>
<ol>
<li>Very economical and reliable.</li>
<li>Construction is simple and robust because there is no centrifugal switch.</li>
</ol>
<p>The disadvantages of shaded pole <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> are</p>
<ol>
<li>Low power factor.</li>
<li>The starting torque is very poor.</li>
<li>The efficiency is very low as, the copper losses are high due to presence of copper band.</li>
<li>The speed reversal is also difficult and expensive as it requires another set of copper rings.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Applications-of-Shaded-Pole-Motor">Applications of Shaded Pole Motor</h3>
<p>Applications of Shaded pole motors <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> are-</p>
<p>Due to their low starting torques  and reasonable cost these motors  are mostly employed in small instruments, hair dryers, toys, record players, small fans, electric clocks  etc. These motors are usually available in a range of 1/300 to 1/20 KW.</p>
