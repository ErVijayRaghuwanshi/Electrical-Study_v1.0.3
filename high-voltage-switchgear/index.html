		<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">The power system deals with <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> above 36KV, is referred as high voltage. As the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level is high the arcing produced during switching operation is also very high. So, special care to be taken during designing of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear. High <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> circuit breaker, is the main component of HV switchgear, hence high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> should have special features for safe and reliable operation. Faulty tripping and switching operation of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> circuit are very rear. Most of the time these <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breakers</a> remain, at ON condition, and may be operated after a long period of time. So CBs must be reliable enough to ensure safe operation, as when required. High <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> technology has changed radically in the last 15 years. </p>
<p><a href="../oil-circuit-breaker-bulk-and-minimum-oil-circuit-breaker/index.html">Minimum oil circuit breaker</a>, <a href="../air-circuit-breaker-air-blast-circuit-breaker/index.html">air blast circuit breaker</a> and <a href="../types-and-operation-of-sf6-circuit-breaker/index.html">SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker</a> are mostly used for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear. <a href="../vacuum-circuit-breaker-or-vcb-and-vacuum-interrupter/index.html">Vacuum circuit breaker</a> is rarely used for this purpose as till date vacuum technology is not adequate for interrupting very high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> short circuit current. There are two types of <a href="../types-and-operation-of-sf6-circuit-breaker/index.html">SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker</a>, single pressure SF<sub>6</sub> breaker and two pressures circuit breaker. The single pressure system is the state of art for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear system, in present time. Now days <a href="../sulfur-hexafluoride-sf6-gas-properties/index.html">SF<sub>6</sub> gas</a> as arc quenching medium, has become most popular for high and extra high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system. Although, <a href="../sulfur-hexafluoride-sf6-gas-properties/index.html">SF<sub>6</sub> gas</a> has strong impact on the greenhouse effect. It has 23 times stronger impact on the greenhouse effect, than that of CO<sub>2</sub>. Hence, leakage of SF<sub>6</sub> gas during the service life of <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> must be prevented. In order to minimize the emission of SF<sub>6</sub> gas, the N<sub>2</sub> - SF<sub>6</sub> and CF<sub>4</sub> - SF<sub>6</sub> gas mixture, may be used in <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a> in future, as substitute of pure SF<sub>6</sub>. It must always be taken care of that, no SF<sub>6</sub> gas comes out in atmosphere during maintenance of the CB.<br />
On the other hand, SF<sub>6</sub> <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> has the major advantage of low maintenance. </p>
</p>
<p>High <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgears are categorized as,</p>
<p>1)  Gas insulated indoor type,<br />
2)  Air insulated outdoor type. </p>
<p>Again, outdoor type air insulated circuit breakers are classified as, </p>
<p>1)	Dead tank type <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a><br />
2)	Live tank type <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> </p>
<p>In dead tank type CB, the switching device is located, with suitable insulator supports inside a metallic vessel(s) at ground potential filled with insulating medium. </p>
<p>In live tank circuit breaker, the interrupts are located in an insulated busing, at the system potential. The live tank circuit breakers are cheaper and required less mounting space. </p>
<p>There are mainly three types of circuit breaker, as we said earlier, used in high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear system i.e. <a href="../air-circuit-breaker-air-blast-circuit-breaker/index.html">air blast circuit breaker</a>, <a href="../types-and-operation-of-sf6-circuit-breaker/index.html">SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker</a>, <a href="../oil-circuit-breaker-bulk-and-minimum-oil-circuit-breaker/index.html">oil circuit breaker</a>. And <a href="../vacuum-circuit-breaker-or-vcb-and-vacuum-interrupter/index.html">vacuum circuit breaker</a> is rarely used. </p>
<p>Air Blast Circuit Breaker </p>
<p>In this design, a blast of high pressure compressed air is used to quench arc between two detaching contacts, when the arc column ionization is least at currents zero. </p>
<p>Oil Circuit Breaker</p>
<p>This is further classified as bulk oil <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> (BOCB) and minimum oil <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> (MOCB).<br />
In BOCB, the interrupting unit is placed inside an oil tank of earth potential. Here oil is used as both insulating and interrupting medium. In MOCB on the other hand, the oil requirement can be minimized by placing the interrupting units in an insulating chamber at live potential on an insulator column. </p>
<p>SF<sub>6</sub> Circuit Breaker</p>
<p><a href="../sulfur-hexafluoride-sf6-gas-properties/index.html">SF<sub>6</sub> gas</a> is widely used as arc quenching medium in HV applications today. Sulfur hexafluoride gas is a high electronegative gas having excellent dielectric and arc quenching properties.<br />
High dielectric and insulating properties of SF<sub>6</sub>, make it possible to design high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> with smaller overall dimension, shorter contact gap.<br />
Excellent insulating property helps to design and construct indoor type high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear. </p>
<p>Vacuum Circuit Breaker</p>
<p>In vacuum, there is no further ionization between two separated  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  carrying contacts, after  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  zero. The initial arc is caused by it will die as soon as next zero crossing but as there is no provision of further ionization once the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is crossed its first zero, the arc quenching is completed. Although the <a href="../arc-interruption-theory/index.html">arc quenching method</a> is very fast in VCB, but till it is not a suitable solution for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear, as VCB made for very high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level is not economical at all.  </p>
<p>The essential features to be provide in high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> circuit breaker, to ensure safe and reliable operation the breakers used in high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear, must be capable of being operated safely for, </p>
<p>1)	Terminal faults.<br />
2)	Short line faults.<br />
3)	Transformer or reactors magnetizing current.<br />
4)	Energizing long transmission line.<br />
5)	Charging <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank.<br />
6)	Switching of out of phase sequence. </p>
<p>Terminal Fault</p>
<p>Generally the load connected to the power system is inductive in nature. Due to this inductance, when short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is just interrupted by a <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a>, there is a chance of high restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of high frequency oscillation in order of few hundred Hz.<br />
 This <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> has two parts<br />
1)	Transient recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> with high frequency oscillation immediately after the arc extinction.<br />
2)	After die down this high frequency oscillation, power frequency recover <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> appears across the CB contacts.  </p>
<p>Transient Recovery Voltage</p>
<p>Just after extinction of arc transient recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> appears across the CB contacts, with high frequency. This transient recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ultimately approaches to open circuit voltage. </p>
<p>This recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> can be represented as<br />
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx </p>
<p>The frequency of oscillation is governed by the circuit parameter L and C. </p>
<p>The <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> present in the power circuit damps out this transient voltage. The transient recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> has not a single frequency, it is combination of may different frequencies due to complexity of the power network. </p>
<p>Power Frequency Recovery Voltage  </p>
<p>This is nothing but open circuit <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltage</a> appears across the CB contacts, just after the transient recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> damped out. In <a href="../three-phase-circuit-star-and-delta-system/index.html" title="Three Phase Star and Delta System">three phase system</a> the power frequency recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> differs in different phase. It is highest in first phase. If the network neutral is not earthed, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the first pole to be cleared is 1.5U where U is the phase voltage. In an earthed neutral system it will be 1.3U.</p>
<p>By using damping <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html">resistor</a>, the magnitude and rate of rise of transient recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> can be limited. The dielectric recovery of the arc quenching medium and rate of rise of transient recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> has great influence on the performance of the <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> used in high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear system. </p>
<p>In air blast circuit breaker, once ionized air is deionized very slowly, thus air takes long time to recover dielectric strength. That is why it is preferable to used low value breaker <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> to slow down rate of rise of recovery voltage. On the other hand <a href="../air-circuit-breaker-air-blast-circuit-breaker/index.html">ABCB</a> is less sensitive to the initial recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> because of high arc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker, the interrupting medium (SF<sub>6</sub>) has faster rate of recovery of dielectric strength, than air. Lower arc voltage, makes SF<sub>6</sub> CB more sensitive to the initial recovery voltage.</p>
<p>In <a href="../oil-circuit-breaker-bulk-and-minimum-oil-circuit-breaker/index.html">oil circuit breaker</a>, during arc having pressurized hydrogen gas (produced during recombination of oil due to arc temperature) provides quick recovery of dielectric strength immediate after  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  zero. Hence OCB is more sensitive to rate of rise of recovery voltage. It is also more sensitive to initial transient recovery voltage. </p>
<p>Short Line Fault</p>
<p>Short line fault in transmission network is defined as the short circuit faults occurred, within 5km of the line length. </p>
<p>Double frequency being impressed on the <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> and the difference of source and line side transient recovery voltage. Both voltages start from instantaneous values at the opposition of the circuit breakers prior to the interruption.</p>
<p>On the supply side the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a>  will oscillate at supply frequency and ultimately approaches to open circuit voltage. On the line side, after interruption, trapped charges initial traveling waves through the transmission line, since there is no driving <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> on the driving side, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ultimately becomes zero because of the line losses. The network diagram and the line side and supply side <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> wave forms are shown in the figure below. </p>
