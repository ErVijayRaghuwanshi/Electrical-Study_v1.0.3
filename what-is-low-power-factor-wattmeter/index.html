As the name suggests the low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> meter are the instruments that measures lower values of <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> accurately. Before we study more about the <strong>low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> meter</strong>, it is very essential to know why there is a requirement of low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> meter though we use ordinary electrodynamometer to measure power factor?<br />
Answer to this question is very simple as it gives inaccurate results. </p>
<p>Now there are two main reasons that would suggests us that we should not use ordinary wattmeter in measuring the low value of power factor.</p>
<p>(1) The value of deflecting torque is very low even though we fully excite the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> and pressure coils.<br />
(2) Errors due pressure coil inductance.</p>
<p>Above two reasons gives very inaccurate results thus we should not use normal or ordinary wattmeters in measuring the<br />
low value of power factor. However by doing some modification or adding some new features we can use modified electrodynamic wattmeter or low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> to measure the low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> accurately. Here we are going to discuss, where we need to do modification. These are discussed one by one below:</p>
<p>(1) Modification in pressure coil:<br />
The electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the ordinary wattmeter's pressure coil is reduced to low value such that  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the pressure coil circuit is increased, thus it leads to. In this category two cases diagrams arises and these are shown below:<br />
<img src="../images/wattmeter-21-11-131.gif" alt="wattmeter" width="628" height="270" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8540" /><br />
In the first category both the ends of the pressure coil is connected to supply side (i.e.  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  coil is in series with the load). The supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is equal to the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a> across the pressure coil. Thus in this case we have power shown by the first wattmeter is equal to the power loss in the load plus power loss in the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  coil. Mathematically, P<sub>1</sub> = power consumed by load + I<sup>2</sup>R<sub>1</sub>.<br />
In the second category, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  coil is not in series with the load and the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the pressure coil is not equal to the applied voltage. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across pressure coil is equal to the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a> across the load. In this power shown by the second wattmeter is equal to the power loss in the load plus the power loss in the pressure coil. Mathematically P<sub>2</sub> = power consumed by load + I<sup>2</sup>R<sub>2</sub>.<br />
From the above discussion we conclude that in both cases we have some amount of errors hence there is need to do some modification in above circuits to have minimum error. The modified circuit is shown below:<br />
We have used here a special coil called compensating coil, it carries  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  equal to the sum of two currents i.e load current  plus pressure coil current. The pressure coil is placed such that the field produced by the compensating coil is opposed by the field produced by pressure coil as shown in the above circuit diagram.<br />
<img src="../images/wattmeter-2-21-11-13.gif" alt="wattmeter with compensating coil" width="534" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8541" /><br />
Thus the net field is due to  the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I only . Hence by this way error caused by pressure coil can be neutralised.</p>
</p>
<p>(2) We require compensating coil in the circuit in order to make the low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> meter. It is the second modification that we have discussed in detail above.</p>
<p>(3) Now the third point deals with the compensation of the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of pressure coil, which can be achieved by doing modification in above circuit.</p>
<p><img src="../images/vector-of-wattmeter-21-11-13.gif" alt="vector-of-wattmeter-21-11-13" width="426" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8542" /></p>
<p>Now let us derive an expression for the correction factor for pressure coil inductance. And from this correction factor we are going to derive an an expression for error due to <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of pressure coil. If we consider the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of pressure coil we dont have <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across pressure in phase with the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a>. Hence it that case it lag by an angle<br />
<img src='1.png' id="latexb%5C%3B%20%20%3D%5C%3Btan%5E%7B-1%7D%20%5Cfrac%7BW_l%7D%7BR%2Br_p%7D&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='b\;  =\;tan^{-1} \frac{W_l}{R+r_p}' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='b\;  =\;tan^{-1} \frac{W_l}{R+r_p}' /><br />
where R is electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in series with pressure coil, r<sub>p</sub> is pressure coil <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, here we also conclude that the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> in the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  coil is also lagging by some angle with the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> in pressure coil. And this angle is given by C = A - b. At this time reading of the voltmeter is given by<br />
<img src='2.png' id="latex%5Cfrac%7BVIcos%28C%29%5Cfrac%7BdM%7D%7Bdx%7D%7D%7BK%2BR_p%7D%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%281%29&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='\frac{VIcos(C)\frac{dM}{dx}}{K+R_p}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot(1)' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='\frac{VIcos(C)\frac{dM}{dx}}{K+R_p}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot(1)' /><br />
Where R<sub>p</sub> is (r<sub>p</sub>+R) and x is angle. If we ignore the effect of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of pressure i.e putting b = 0 we have expression for true power as<br />
<img src='3.png' id="latex%5Cfrac%7BVI%20cos%28A%29%5Cfrac%7BdM%7D%7Bdx%7D%7D%7BK%5Ccdot%20R_p%7D%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%5Ccdot%282%29&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='\frac{VI cos(A)\frac{dM}{dx}}{K\cdot R_p}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot(2)' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='\frac{VI cos(A)\frac{dM}{dx}}{K\cdot R_p}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot(2)' /><br />
On taking ratio of equations (2) and (1) we have expression for correction factor as written below:<br />
<img src='4.png' id="latex%5Cfrac%7Bcos%28A%29%7D%7Bcos%28b%29cos%28A-b%29%7D&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='\frac{cos(A)}{cos(b)cos(A-b)}' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='\frac{cos(A)}{cos(b)cos(A-b)}' /><br />
And from this correction factor error can be calculated as<br />
Error = (1 - (correction factor))*(actual reading of the voltmeter). On substituting the value of correction factor and taking suitable approximation we have expression for error as VIsin(A)*tan(b).<br />
<img src="../images/wattmeter-3-21-11-13.png" alt="wattmeter" width="480" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8543" /><br />
Now we know that the error caused by pressure coil <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> is given by the expression e=VIsin(A) tan(b), if <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> is low (i.e in our case the value of &phi; is large hence we have large error). Thus in order to avoid this situation we have connect the variable series <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> with a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> as shown in the above figure. This final modified circuit so obtained is called low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> meter. A modern low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> meter is designed such that it gives high accuracy while measuring power factors even lower than 0.1.</p>
