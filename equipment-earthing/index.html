<h2 id="What_is_Earthing_?">What is Earthing?</h2>
<p><strong>Equipment earthing</strong> is a connection done through a metal link between the body of any electrical appliance, or neutral point, as the case may be, to the deeper ground soil.  The metal link is normally of MS flat, CI flat, GI wire which should be penetrated to the ground earth grid.</p>

<h2 id="Necessity_of_Equipment_Earthing"> Necessity of Equipment Earthing</h2>
<p>Protection<br />
(a)	 Safety of personnel<br />
(b)	 Safety of equipment<br />
    	 Prevent or at least minimize damage to equipment as a result of flow of heavy <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" >electric currents</a>.<br />
(c)      Improvement of  the reliability of the power system.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Classification_of_Earthing">Classification of Earthing </h2>
<p>          The earthing is broadly divided as<br />
a)    System earthing (Connection between part of  plant in an operating system like LV neutral of a <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >power transformer</a> winding) and earth.<br />
b)   Equipment earthing (safety grounding) connecting bodies of equipment (like <a href="../electrical-motor-types-classification-and-history-of-motor/index.html" >electric motor</a> body, transformer tank, <a href="../electrical-switchgear-protection/index.html" >switchgear</a> box, operating rods of air break switches, LV breaker body, HV breaker body, feeder breaker bodies etc) to earth.</p>
<h2 id="Permissible_Values_of_Earth_Resistance">Permissible Values of Earth Resistance</h2>
<p>a)   Power stations             -  0.5 ohms<br />
b)   EHT stations               -  1.0 ohms<br />
c)   33KV SS                    -  2 ohms<br />
d)   DTR structures             -  5 ohms<br />
e)   Tower foot <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>      -  10 ohms</p>
<h2 id="What_is_the_Basics_for_arriving_at_Permissible_Earth_Resistances_?">What is the Basics for arriving at Permissible Earth Resistances?</h2>
<p>        As per IE rules one has to have a definite base for that as per IE rules one has to keep touch potential less than<br />
       a)   Recommended safe value 523 volts<br />
       b)   I<sub>fault</sub> = maximum  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in fault conditions,<br />

d)      For a substation of 100 KVA transformer<br />

0.26 ohms being quite low, quality work is to be done during construction, to obtain such a value of earthing system, and the expenditure for that will be very high.<br />
Hence the electrical inspectors are insisting about 1.0 ohms. This seems justifying for the urban areas. This value may be 2 ohms in case of rural areas, which is recommended by most of the authorities.<br />
e)      The earth electrode <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> value also carries importance in view of full protection by lightning arrestors against lightning.<br />
The earth electrode <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> value in that case is given by the formula<br />

<h3 id="Plate_Type_Earthing">Plate Type Earthing</h3>
<p>In this, cast Iron plate of size 600 mm X 600 mm X 6.3 mm thick plate is being used as earth plate. This is being connected with Hot dip GI main earth strip of size 50mm X 6mm thick X 2.5 meter long by means of nut, bolts &#038; washers of required size. The main earth strip is connected with hot dip GI strip of size 40mm X 3mm of required length as per the site location up to the equipment earth / neutral connection. The earth plate is back filled &#038; covered with earthing material (mixture of charcoal &#038; salt) by 150mm from all six sides. The remaining pit is back filled with excavated earth. Along with earth plate, rigid PVC pipe of 2.5 meter long is also provided in the earth pit for watering purpose for to keep the earthing <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> within specific limit.</p>
<h3 id="Pipe_Type_Earthing">Pipe Type Earthing</h3>
<p>In this hot dip GI pipe of size 40mm dia X 2.5 meter is being used for equipment earthing. This pipe is perforated at each interval of 100mm and is tapered at lower end. A clamped is welded with this pipe at 100mm below the top for making connection with hot dip GI strip of size 40mm X 3mm of required length as per the site location up to the equipment earth / neutral connection. On its open end funnel is being fitted for watering purpose. The earth pipe is placed inside 2700 mm depth pit. A 600mm dia “farma“ of GI sheet or cement pipe in two halves is are placed around the pipe. Then the angular space between this “farma” and earth pipe is back filled with alternate layer of 300mm height with salt and charcoal. The remaining space outside “farma” will be backfilled by excavated earth. The “farma” is gradually lifted up as the backfilling up progresses. Thus the pit is being filled up to the 300mm below the ground level. This remaining portion is covered by constructing a small chamber of brick so that top open end of pipe and connection with main earth pipe will be accessible for attending when necessary. The chamber is closed by wooden / stone cover. Water is poured into the pipe through its open end funnel to keep the earthing <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> within specific limit.</p>
<p>Other  types of earthing :  When the capabilities of certain equipment are limited, they may not with stand  certain fault currents then the following types of earthing are resorted to limit the fault current.  </p>

              (c)    Peterson coil earthing.<br />
