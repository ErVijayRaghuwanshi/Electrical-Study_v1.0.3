We know that inductive reactance X<sub>L</sub> = 2&pi;fL means inductive reactance is directly proportional to frequency ( X<sub>L</sub> &#038;prop ƒ ). When the frequency is zero or in case of DC, inductive reactance is also zero, the circuit acts as a short circuit; but when frequency increases; inductive reactance also increases. At infinite frequency, inductive reactance becomes infinity and circuit behaves as open circuit. It means that, when frequency increases inductive reactance also increases and when frequency decreases, inductive reactance also decreases. So if we plot a graph between inductive reactance and frequency, it is a straight line linear curve passing through origin as shown in the figure above.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_5591" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 352px"><a href="../resonance-in-rlc-circuit/rrlcc-3/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-5591"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rrlcc-3.png" alt="Variation of Capacitive Reactance Vs Frequency" width="342" height="259" class="size-full wp-image-5591" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Variation of Capacitive Reactance Vs Frequency</p></div><br />
It is clear from the formula of capacitive reactance X<sub>C</sub> =  1 / 2πfC that, frequency and capacitive reactance are inversely proportional to each other. In case of DC or when frequency is zero, capacitive reactance becomes infinity and circuit behaves as open circuit and when frequency increases and becomes infinite, capacitive reactance decreases and becomes zero at infinite frequency, at that point the circuit acts as short circuit, so the capacitive reactance increases with decease in frequency and if we plot a graph between capacitive reactance and frequency, it is an hyperbolic curve as shown in figure above.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_5592" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 508px"><a href="../resonance-in-rlc-circuit/rrlcc-4/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-5592"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rrlcc-4.png" alt="Inductive Reactance and Capacitive Reactance Vs Frequency" width="498" height="338" class="size-full wp-image-5592" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inductive Reactance and Capacitive Reactance Vs Frequency</p></div><br />
From the above discussion, it can be concluded that the inductive reactance is directly proportional to frequency and capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to frequency, i.e at low frequency X<sub>L</sub> is low and X<sub>C</sub> is high but there must be a frequency, where the value of inductive reactance becomes equal to capacitive reactance. Now if we plot a single graph of inductive reactance vs frequency and capacitive reactance vs frequency, then there must occur a point where these two graphs cut each other. At that point of intersection, the inductive and capacitive reactance becomes equal and the frequency at which these two reactances become equal, is called resonant frequency, f<sub>r</sub>.<br />
At resonant frequency, X<sub>L</sub> = X<sub>L</sub><br />

At resonance f = f<sub>r</sub> and on solving above equation we get,<br />

At <strong>resonance in series RLC circuit</strong>, two reactances become equal and cancel each other. So in resonant series RLC circuit, the opposition to the flow of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is due to <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> only. At resonance, the total impedance of series RLC circuit is equal to <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> i.e Z = R, impedance has only real part but no imaginary part and this impedance at resonant frequency is called dynamic impedance and this dynamic impedance is always less than impedance of series RLC circuit. Before series resonance i.e before frequency, f<sub>r</sub> capacitive reactance dominates and after resonance, inductive reactance dominates and at resonance the circuit acts purely as  resistive circuit causing a large amount of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to circulate through the circuit.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_5598" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 400px"><a href="../resonance-in-rlc-circuit/rrlcc-6/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-5598"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rrlcc-6.png" alt="Resonant Current" width="390" height="325" class="size-full wp-image-5598" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Resonant Current</p></div><br />
In series RLC circuit, the total <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is the phasor sum of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  and capacitor. At <strong>resonance in series RLC circuit</strong>, both inductive and capacitive reactance cancel each other and we know that in series circuit, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing through all the elements is same, So the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  and <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and thereby they cancel each other. So, in a series resonant circuit, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is equal to supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> i.e V = V<sub>r</sub>.</p>
<p>In series RLC circuit current, I = V / Z  but at resonance  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I = V / R , therefore the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  at resonant frequency is maximum as at resonance in impedance of circuit is <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> only and is minimum.</p>
<p>The above graph shows the plot between circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and frequency. At starting, when the frequency increases, the impedance Z<sub>c</sub> decreases and hence the circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  increases. After some time frequency becomes equal to resonant frequency, at that point inductive reactance becomes equal to capacitive reactance and the impedance of circuit reduces and is equal to circuit <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> only. So at this point, the circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  becomes maximum I = V / R. Now when the frequency is further increased, Z<sub>L</sub> increases and with increase in  Z<sub>L</sub>, the circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  reduces and then the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  drops finally to zero as frequency becomes infinite.</p>

At resonance, the inductive reactance is equal to capacitive reactance and hence the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  and <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> cancel each other. The total impedance of circuit is <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> only. So, the circuit behaves like a pure resistive circuit and we know that in pure resistive circuit, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and the circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  are in same phase i.e V<sub>r</sub> , V and I are in same phase direction. Therefore, the phase angle between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is zero and the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> is unity.</p>

<p>Since <strong>resonance in series RLC circuit</strong> occurs at particular frequency, so it is used for filtering and tuning purpose as it does not allow unwanted oscillations that would otherwise cause signal distortion, noise and damage to circuit to pass through it.</p>
<p><span class="Green"><b>Summary</b></span><br />
For a series RLC circuit at certain frequency called resonant frequency, the following points must be remembered. So at resonance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inductive reactance X<sub>L</sub> is equal to capacitive reactance X<sub>C</sub>.</li>
<li>Total impedance of circuit becomes minimum which is equal to R i.e Z = R.</li>
<li>Circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  becomes maximum as impedance reduces, I = V / R.</li>
<li>Voltage across <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  and <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance?
