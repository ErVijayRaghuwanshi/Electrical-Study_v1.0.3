<p>Such transformers are normally used in high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> laboratory for extra <a href="../high-voltage-testing/index.html"  >high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> testing</a> purpose. This transformer is subjected to transient voltages and surges during their normal operation when the insulation under test breaks down. To withstand these impulse voltages, the insulation of transformer is carefully designed. This high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer is single phase, core type. This <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html"  >type of transformer</a> is generally oil immersed. Bakelite sheets are used for separating high tension and low tension winding. The high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformers used for HT cable testing purpose are to supply also sufficient <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html"  >electric current</a> and that is why the cooling system of these transformers is very carefully designed. Special cares also to be taken for <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html"  >voltage regulation of transformer</a>s. For insulator testing purposes, the required  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is very tiny but, while the insulator breaks down during testing, there would flow huge  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the transformer. To limit this current, a high <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is connected in series with transformer. As the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  required is very less during insulation testing, this high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer needs not to have high KVA ratings. The table below shows, the rating of transformer used for various testing purposes.</p>
</p>
<p>Up to <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> 500 KV, generally single one high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer is used. But for higher <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> more than one transformer, are connected in cascade to produce required high voltage. Actually for getting such high voltage, a single transformer has to be very huge in size which is not at all economical.</p>
<p>	The figure below shows the typical cascading connection of two transformers.</p>

<p>Low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is supplied to the low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> winding of a step up transformer 1 as shown in the figure below. The tank of this transformer is earthed. The secondary of this transformer, is connected to the earthed tank and other end comes out through a high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> bushing. The bushing is so specially designed and manufactured, that it can withstand full secondary high voltage, in respect of earthed potential of transformer tank.

<h2 id="Voltage-Regulation">Voltage Regulation</h2>
<p>	The surges on the high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> side of the transformer should be avoided. Also for accuracy of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> measurement, the <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html"  >voltage regulation of transformer</a> should be smooth enough. Sudden variation of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> during test also to be avoided. A <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulator should not distort the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> wave form during testing.</p>
<p>	The output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer is regulated by changing input <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the primary side.</p>
<p> This variation of input <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the primary can be done either by</p>
<p>1)	Variation of <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html"  >alternator</a> field current.<br />
2)	Inserting <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> or <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> in the supply circuit from <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html"  >alternator</a>.<br />
3)	Using induction regulator.<br />
4)	Using tapped transformer.</p>
<h3 id="Variation-of-Alternator-Field-Current">Variation of Alternator Field Current</h3>
<p>	If one single <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html"  >alternator</a> is used to supply power to the high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer, the method of variation of <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html" title="Alternator or Synchronous Generator">alternator</a> field  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  can be performed. An <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html" title="Alternator or Synchronous Generator">alternator</a> gives sinusoidal wave form of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> at no load. But it is also desirable, that, this <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> waveform should not be distorted under load condition. This is achieved by making larger air gap between stator and rotor and by special design of <a href="../armature-winding-of-alternator/index.html"  >armature winding of alternator</a>.<br />
<div id="attachment_8988" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 544px"><img src="../images/alternator-field-control.gif" alt="Alternator Field Control" width="534" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-8988" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Alternator Field Control</p></div><br />
	For regulating voltage, no impedance is required to be connected in series with the primary of the transformer, in this case. So <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> wave form distortion due to inserted impedance can be avoided by <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html"  >voltage regulation</a> with variation of <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html" title="Alternator or Synchronous Generator">alternator</a> field current. The field  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of the <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html" title="Alternator or Synchronous Generator">alternator</a> is varied by a voltage, divider, connected across DC supply to the field. In this method zero <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> can be achieved by neutralizing residual magnetism of field by severing required field current.</p>
<h3 id="Voltage-Regulation-by-Inserting-Resistance-or-Inductance">Voltage Regulation by Inserting <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">Resistance</a> or Inductance</h3>
<p>	When there is no provision of using separate <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html" title="Alternator or Synchronous Generator">alternator</a> for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> testing in the lab, this method is applied. The high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer is fed from AC supply mains in case of testing of small equipments. The variation of supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the   H. V. transformer is obtained by inserting  <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in series with the AC supply. A sliding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is most suitable for achieving smooth regulation of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> supplied to the transformer primary. Sometimes the resistance can also be connected across main supply and used as <a href="../voltage-divider/index.html" title="Voltage Divider">voltage divider</a>, to supply variable <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the transformer.<br />
<div id="attachment_8989" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 544px"><img src="../images/potential-divider-control.gif" alt="potential divider control" width="534" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-8989" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Potential Divider Control</p></div><br />
	This method is quite simple but it suffers from power loss problem. The power loss across the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is not practically accepted for high power tests. The <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> required for high power application is quite large in size and cost. Because of these disadvantages this method is limited upto the application for the equipment rated from 2 KVA to 3 KVA.</p>
<p>	Instead of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> can be achieved by connecting a choke coil (inductor) in series with the primary of the transformer. Voltage variation can be obtained by changing the position of iron core in the choke coil. That means, by inserting and withdrawing iron core inside the coil, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> variation is achieved. Due to lower power loss, this method is more efficient than <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> method. But still it has some inherent disadvantages.</p>
<p>1)	For higher power, very large size of this choke coil is required.<br />
2)	There is always a good chance of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> distortion due to iron core in the coil.<br />
3)	Another disadvantage of this method, is in fact that increase of its <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> will increase the primary <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the transformer instead of decreasing it if the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> of the load on the secondary ride of the testing transformer is leading as is often the case.</p>
<h3 id="Induction-Regulator-Method">Induction Regulator Method</h3>
<p>	Inductance regulator control is suitable for all ranges of power. It can be efficiently used for all load and power factors. Smooth <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> from zero to full range can be achieved by this method.In induction regulator is essentially a variable transformer. The secondary <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of this variable transformer can be varied by changing primary turns. Variation of primary turns is achieved by rotating a knob attached to the transformer.<br />
	Actually in this type of variable transformer, the number of turns in primary and secondary windings are same. But when we rotate the said knob attached to the transformer the number of active turns across primary varies, hence turns ratio changes which ultimately results to variable secondary voltage.<br />
	During designing this type of transformer it must be kept in  mind that, the winding of transformer on rotor portion are so designed and distributed that, it does not distort the actual wave form of the test voltage.<br />
	Induction regulator method is most suitable for the high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer, used for power cable testing purpose. Because its gradual <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> variation at loads of any magnitude is advantageous for such work.</p>
<div id="attachment_8990" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 544px"><img src="../images/inductor-regulator.gif" alt="inductor regulator" width="534" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-8990" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Inductor Regulator</p></div>
<h3 id="Voltage-Variation-by-Means-of-Tapped-Transformer">Voltage Variation by Means of Tapped Transformer</h3>
<p>	In this method of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer, a tapped transformer is essentially used. The theory of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> variation by tapped transformer is quite simple.<br />
	In this arrangement the primary of transformer is connected with LT supply main. The secondary winding of the transformer is tapped at various points. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> at primary of HT transformer is supplied from these tapped points.<br />
	When the contact of tapping switch moves from one tap to another, these would be a chance of opening the secondary circuit of tapping transformer. Due to this opening there may be a high chance of surge in the high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer.<br />
	To avoid this situation two contact brushes are used for tap changer switch. It makes contact with adjacent studs and with a buffer <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> or reactance coil between them to prevent short circuit of a section of the transformer winding.<br />
	Here in the diagram we have shown a two winding transformer as tapped transformer but it can be auto transformer too.<br />
	For gradual regulation a number of course tapping are used together with fine tappings. This method of <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> by tapped transformer is advantageous for its high efficiency and small wave form distortion as there is no <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops in the circuit, only the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> wave is stepped up.<br />
As the winding is tapped the <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> is not very smooth. But it can be made smoother by using very large number of taps in the secondary winding of tapped transformer but it increases cost of the transformer.<br />
	Hence this method of <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> is used on high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer only when it is required for large and expensive switchgear testing.<br />
