<p><strong>MOSFET</strong> stands for metal oxide <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> field effect transistor. It is capable of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> gain and signal power gain. The <strong>MOSFET</strong> is the core of integrated circuit designed as thousands of these can be fabricated in a single chip because of its very small size. Every modern electronic system consists of VLST technology and without MOSFET, large scale integration is impossible.</p>
<p>It is a four terminals device. The drain and source terminals are connected to the heavily doped regions. The gate terminal is connected top on the oxide layer and the substrate or body terminal is connected to the intrinsic semiconductor.</p>
<p>MOSFET has four terminals which is already stated above, they are gate, source drain and substrate or body. MOS capacity present in the device is the main part. The conduction and valance bands are position relative to the Fermi level at the surface is a function of MOS <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> voltage. The metal of the gate terminal and the sc acts the parallel and the oxide layer acts as insulator of the state MOS capacitor. Between the drain and source terminal inversion layer is formed and due to the flow of carriers in it, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows in MOSFET the inversion layer is properties are controlled by gate voltage. Thus it is a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> controlled device.</p>
<p>Two basic types of MOSFET are n channel and p channel MOSFETs. In n channel MOSFET is  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is due to the flow of electrons in inversion layer and in p channel  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is due to the flow of holes.</p>
<p>Another type of characteristics of clarification can be made of those are enhancement type and depletion type MOSFETs. In enhancement mode, these are normally off and turned on by applying gate voltage. The opposite phenomenon happens in depletion type MOSFETs.</p>
<h2 id="Working-Principle-of-MOSFET">Working Principle of MOSFET</h2>
<p>The working principle of MOSFET depends up on the MOS capacitor. The MOS <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> is the main part. The <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> surface at below the oxide layer and between the drain and source terminal can be inverted from p-type to n-type by applying a positive or negative gate voltages respectively. When we apply positive gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> the holes present beneath the oxide layer experience repulsive force and the holes are pushed downward with the substrate. The depletion region is populated by the bound negative charges, which are associated with the acceptor atoms. The positive <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> also attracts electrons from the n+ source and drain regions in to the channel. The electron reach channel is formed. Now, if a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is applied between the source and the drain,  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows freely between the source and drain gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> controls the electrons concentration the channel. Instead of positive if apply negative <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> a hole channel will be formed beneath the oxide layer.</p>
</p>
<p>Now, the controlling of source to gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is responsible for the conduction of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  between source and the drain. If the gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> exceeds a given value, called the three <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> only then the conduction begins.</p>
<p>The  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  equation of MOSFET in triode region is - <br/><br />

<h2 id="P-Channel-MOSFET">P-Channel MOSFET</h2>
<p>MOSFET which has p - channel region between source any gate is known as <strong>p - channel MOSFET</strong>. It is a four terminal devices, the terminals are gate, drain, source and substrate or body. The drain and source are heavily doped p+ region and the substrate is in n-type. The  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows due to the flow of positively charged holes that’s why it is known as p-channel MOSFET. When we apply negative gate voltage, the electrons present beneath the oxide layer, experiences repulsive force and they are pushed downward in to the substrate, the depletion region is populated by the bound positive charges which are associated with the donor atoms. The negative gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> also attracts holes from p+ source and drain region in to the channel region. Thus hole which channel is formed now if a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> between the source and the drain is applied  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows. The gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> controls the hole concentration of the channel.

<h2 id="N-Channel-MOSFET">N-Channel MOSFET</h2>
<p>MOSFET having n-channel region between source and drain is known as <strong>n-channel MOSFET </strong>. It is a four terminal device, the terminals are gate, drain and source and substrate or body. The drain and source are heavily doped n+ region and the substrate is p-type.  The  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>   flows due to flow of the negatively charged electrons, that’s why it is known as n- channel MOSFET.

The positive gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> also attracts electrons from n+ source and drain region in to the channel thus an electron reach channel is formed, now if a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is applied between the source and drain. The gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> controls the electron concentration in the channel n-channel MOSFET is preferred over p-channel MOSFET as the mobility of electrons are higher than holes.
