<p>The <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> demand is rising rapidly. Now days, huge quantity of <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> is necessary to transmit from one place to other for fulfilling this rising power demand. Bulk power transmission can be most efficiently done through high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electrical-power-transmission-system-and-network/index.html">electrical power transmission system</a>. Hence, high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> system becomes most essential requirement for power transmission. The equipments used in these high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transmission system, should be capable of withstanding this high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stress.</p>
<p>But in addition to that normal high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> withstanding capability, a high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equipment must also be capable of withstanding different over voltages during its operational life span. These different over voltages may occur during various abnormal conditions.</p>
<p>	These abnormal over voltages can not be avoided hence, the insulation level of the equipment is so designed and manufactured, that, it can withstand all these abnormal conditions.</p>
<p>	To ensure the capabilities of withstanding these abnormal over voltages, the equipment must go through different high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> testing procedures.</p>
<p>	Some of these tests are used to ensure, permittivity, dielectric losses per unit volume and dielectric strength of an insulating material. These tests are generally carried out on a specimen of insulating material. Some other high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> tests are carried out on the complete equipments. These tests are far measuring and ensuring, capacitance, dielectric losses, break down voltage, and flash over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> etc. of the equipment as a whole.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-High-Voltage-Test">Types of High Voltage Test</h2>
<p>There are mainly four <strong>types of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> testing methods</strong> applied on high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equipment and these are </p>
<p>1.	Sustained low frequency tests.</p>
<p>2.	Constant DC test.</p>
<p>3.	High frequency test.</p>
<p>4.	Surge or impulse test.</p>
<h3 id="Sustained-Low-Frequency-Test">Sustained Low Frequency Test</h3>
<p>	This test is generally done at power frequency (In India it is 50 Hz &#038; in America it is 60 Hz). This is most commonly used high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> test, carried on H.V. equipment. This test i.e. sustained low frequency test are carried out on a specimen of insulating material to determine and ensure, dielectric strength, dielectric losses of the insulating material. This test is also carried out on high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equipment and high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electrical-insulator-insulating-material-porcelain-glass-polymer-insulator/index.html" >electrical insulators</a> to ensure the dielectric strength and losses of these equipment and insulators. </p>
<h4 id="Sustained-Low-Frequency-Testing-Procedure">Sustained Low Frequency Testing Procedure</h4>
<p>The testing procedure is very simple. High <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is applied across a specimen of insulation or equipment under test by means of a high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer. A <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is connected with series with the transformer to limit the short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the event of breakdown occurred in the device under test. The <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is rated with as many ohms as the high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> applied across the device under test. That means the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> must be rated 1 ohm / volt. For example if we apply 200 KV during the test, the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> must have 200 K&ohm;, so that during ultimate short circuit condition, the faulty  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  must be limited to 1 A. For this test the power frequency high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is applied to the specimen or equipment under test for a long specific period to ensure the continuous high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> withstanding capability of the device.</p>
<p><span class="Green">N. B. : The transformer used for producing extra high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in this type of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> testing procedure, may not be of high power rating. Since, although the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is very high, but maximum  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is limited to 1A in this transformer. Sometimes, cascaded transformers are used to get very high voltage, if required.</span></p>
<h3 id="High-Voltage-D.C.-Test">High Voltage D. C. Test</h3>
<p>High <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> DC test is normally applicable to the those equipments which are used in high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> DC transmission system. But this test is also applicable for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> AC equipments, when high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> AC testing is not possible due to unavoidable condition. For example mainly at site, after installation of equipments it is quite difficult to arrange for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> alternating power as high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer may not be available at site. Hence, high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> test with alternating power is not possible at site after installation of equipment. At that situation high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> DC test is most suitable.</p>
<p>In high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> direct  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  test of AC equipment, direct <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> about two times of the normal rated <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is applied across the equipment under test for 15 minutes to 1.5 hours. Although high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> DC test is not complete substitute of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> AC test but still it is applicable where HVAC test is not at all possible.</p>
<h3 id="High-Frequency-Test">High Frequency Test</h3>
<p>The insulators used at high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transmission system, may be subjected to breakdown or flash-over during high frequency disturbances. The high frequency disturbances occurs in the HV system due to switching operations or any other external causes. High frequency in power may cause failure of insulators even at comparatively low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> due to high dielectric loss and heating. So the insulation of all high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equipment must ensure the high frequency <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> withstanding capacity during its normal life span. Mainly sudden interruption of line  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  during switching and open circuit fault, gives rise to the frequency of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> wave form in the system.</p>
<p>It is found the dielectric loss for every cycle of the power is nearly constant. So at high frequency the dielectric loss per second becomes much higher than that of normal power frequency. This fast and large dielectric loss causes excessive heating of the insulator. Excessive heating ultimately results to insulation failure may be by blasting of insulators. So to ensure this high frequency <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> withstanding capacity, high frequency test is carried out on high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equipments.</p>
<h3 id="Surge-Test-or-Impulse-Test">Surge Test or Impulse Test</h3>
<p>There may be great influence of surge or lighting on the transmission lines. These phenomena can breakdown transmission line insulator and it may also attack, the <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a> connected at the end of the transmission lines. Surge test or impulse tests are very high or extra high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> tests, carried out for investing the influences of surges or lightning on the transmission equipment. Normally direct lightening strokes on transmission line is very rare. But when a charged cloud comes closer to the transmission line, the line is oppositely charged due to the electrical charge inside the cloud. When this charged cloud is suddenly discharged due to lightning stroke nearby, the induced charge of the line no longer bound but travel through the line with velocity of light. So it is understood that even when the lightnings do not strike the transmission conductor, directly, still there will be a transient over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> disturbance.</p>
<p>Due to lightning discharge on the line or nearby to the line, a step fronted <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> wave travel along the line. The wave form is shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_8934" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 525px"><img src="../images/surge-waveform.gif" alt="Surge Waveform" width="515" height="268" class="size-full wp-image-8934" /><p class="wp-caption-text">surge waveform</p></div>
<p>During traveling of this wave, high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stress occurred on the insulator. Due to which violent rupture of insulators is often caused by such lightning impulse. So proper investigation, of the insulator and insulating parts of high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equipment, should be done properly by high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> testing. The lightning impulse is totally natural phenomenon so it does not have any predetermined shape and size of the steep-fronted voltage. So, for performing this high  <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> testing, a standard <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> wave is applied. Although this standard <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> may not have any similarity in height and shape with the actual impulse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> due to lightning or surges.</p>
<p>In Britain in BSS 923 : 1940, the standard testing wave is expressed as 1/50 &nu;sec which means, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rises to its peak within 1 micro second and fall to 50% of its peak value within 50 micro second. As per Indian standard, the impulse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is expressed as 12/50 &nu;sec. That indicates, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rises to its peak at 12 micro seconds and falls back to 50% of its peak at 50 micro second. </p>
