<p><strong>Transformer winding resistance measurement</strong> is carried out as a type test, routine test and also as a field test.</p>
<p>In the factory, it helps in determining the following :</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculation of the I<sup>2</sup>R <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" >losses in transformer.</a></li>
<li>Calculation of winding temperature at the end of temperature rise test of transformer.</li>
<li>As a benchmark for assessing possible damages in the field.</li>
</ol>
<p> It is done at site in order to check for abnormalities due to loose connections, broken strands of conductor, high contact <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in tap changers, high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> leads and bushings. </p>
<h4 id="Procedure-of-Transformer-Winding-Resistance-Measurement">Procedure of Transformer Winding Resistance Measurement</h4>
<p>For star connected winding, the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> shall be measured between the line and neutral terminal. </p>
<p>For star connected auto-transformers the resistance of the HV side is measured between HV terminal and IV terminal, then between IV terminal and the neutral.</p>
<p>For delta connected windings, <strong>measurement of winding resistance</strong> shall be done between pairs of line terminals. As in delta connection the resistance of individual winding can not be measured separately, the resistance per winding shall be calculated as per the following formula:<br />
               <center>Resistance per winding = 1.5 x Measured value</center></p>
<p>The <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is measured at ambient temperature and then converted to <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> at 75ËšC for all practical purposes of comparison with specified design values, previous results and diagnostics. </p>
<p>Winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">Resistance</a> at standard temperature of 75&deg; C<br />
<center><img src="../equations/twr1.gif" alt=""/></center></p>
</p>
<p>R<sub>t</sub> = Winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> at temperature t.<br />
t = Winding temperature.</p>
<p>Generally transformer windings are immersed in insulation liquid and covered with paper insulation, hence it is impossible to measure the actual winding temperature in a de-energizing transformer at time of <strong>transformer winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> measurement</strong>. An approximation is developed to calculate temperature of winding at that condition, as follows<br />
         <center>Temperature of winding = Average temperature of insulating oil.</center></p>
<p>(Average temperature of insulating oil should be taken 3 to 8 hours after de-energizing transformer and when the difference between top &amp; bottom oil temperatures becomes less than 5&deg; C.)</p>
<p>The <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> can be measured by simple voltmeter ammeter method, Kelvin Bridge meter or automatic winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> measurement kit. (ohm meter, preferably 25 Amps kit)</p>
<p>Caution for voltmeter ammeter method: Current shall not exceed 15% of the rated  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of the winding. Large values may cause inaccuracy by heating the winding and thereby changing its temperature and <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>.<br />
<span class="Green">NB: - <strong>Measurement of winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of transformer</strong> shall be carried out at each tap. </span></p>
<h2 id="Current-Voltage-Method-of-Measurement-of-Winding-Resistance">Current Voltage Method of Measurement of Winding Resistance</h2>
<p>The transformer winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s can be measured  by  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> method. In this method of measurement of winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, the test  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is injected to the winding and corresponding <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across the winding is measured.</p>
<p>By applying simple <a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html" >Ohm's law</a> i.e. R<sub>x</sub> = V &frasl; I, one can easily determine the value of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Procedure-of-Current-Voltage-Method-of-Measurement-of-Winding-Resistance">Procedure of Current Voltage Method of Measurement of Winding Resistance</h3>
<ol>
<li>Before measurement the transformer should be kept in OFF condition without excitation at least for 3 to 4 hours. During this time the winding temperature will become equal to its oil temperature.</li>
<li>Measurement is done with D.C.</li>
<li>To minimize observation errors, polarity of the core magnetization shall be kept constant during all <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> readings.</li>
<li>Voltmeter leads shall be independent of the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  leads to protect it from high voltages which may occur during switching on and off the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  circuit.</li>
<li>The readings shall be taken after the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a>  have reached steady state values. In some cases this may take several minutes depending upon the winding impedance.</li>
<li>The test  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  shall not exceed 15% of the rated  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of the winding. Large values may cause inaccuracy  by heating the winding and thereby changing its <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>.</li>
<li>For expressing <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, the corresponding temperature of the winding at the time of measurement must be mentioned along with <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> value. As we said earlier that after remaining in switch off condition for 3 to 4 hours, the winding temperature would become equal to oil temperature. The oil temperature at the time of testing is taken as the average of top oil and bottom oil temperatures of transformer.</li>

<li>For star connected three phase winding, the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> per phase would be half of measured <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> between two line terminals of the transformer.</li>
<li>For delta connected three phase winding, the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> per phase would be 0.67 times of measured resistance between two line terminals of the transformer.</li>

<h2 id="Bridge-Method-of-Measurement-of-Winding-Resistance">Bridge Method of Measurement of Winding Resistance</h2>
<p><img src="../images/kelvin-bridge.jpg" alt="kelvin double bridge" title="Kelvin Bridge" class="alignright"/> </p>
<p>The main principle of bridge method is based on comparing an unknown <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> with a known <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. When electric currents flowing through the arms of bridge circuit become balanced, the reading of galvanometer shows zero deflection that means at balanced condition no  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> will flow through the galvanometer. Very small value of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> ( in milli-ohms range) can be accurately measured by Kelvin bridge method whereas for higher value Wheatstone bridge method of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> measurement is applied. In bridge method of measurement of winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, the errors is minimized.<br />

All other steps to be taken during transformer winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> measurement in these methods are similar to that of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> method of <strong>measurement of winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of transformer</strong>, except the measuring technique of resistance.<br />
