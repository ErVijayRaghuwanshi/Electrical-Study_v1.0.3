<h2 id="Definition-of-Mesh-Network">Definition of Mesh Network</h2>
<p>The smallest unit of loop within which no other closed loop exists, is called mesh. All electrical closed networks either consist of single closed loop or a number of closed loops within them. Thus it can be easily said that every closed electrical network is <strong>mesh network</strong>. If any electrical network consists of only one single closed loop is referred as <strong>single mesh network</strong>, on the other hand if the network has more than one closed circuital loops, the network is referred as <strong>multi mesh network</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-Mesh?">What is Mesh?</h3>
<p>Suppose you have an electric source such as a dry  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  cell, a LED and two pieces of conducting wire. If you want to make the LED to glow, the positive terminal of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  must be connected with one lead of LED by means of one conducting wire and in same way the negative terminal of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  must be connected to other lead of LED via another conducting wire.<br />
<img src="../images01/led.gif" style="width:200px;" alt="" /><br />
If you disconnect any of the points in that closed network , the LED will not glow; that means  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  can only flow through the LED as long as the continuity of the circuit exists. The  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  , then wire, then LED, then another wire and then again  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  form a closed loop and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  only flows as long as the loop remains closed. This loop is known as a mesh. The network formed is a single <strong>mesh network</strong>. Again if two LEDs are connected in same manner across the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  , you can see that there would be two closed loops formed as shown in the figure. Every loop is referred as a mesh and the latter network is referred as <strong>multi mesh network</strong>.</p>
<p>The figure shown below has 6 nodes, five branches, three loops and two meshes.</p>
<p><span class='Green'>
<li>A node is a junction point in a network where two or more branches meet.</li>
<li>A branch of network is the section which joints two nodes directly without passing through a third node.</li>
<li>A loop in a network is the closed path formed by any number of possible connected branches.</li>
<li>A mesh is a closed loop which contains no other loop within it.</li>

<h1 id="Mesh-Analysis">Mesh Analysis</h1>
<p>In this technique of circuit analysis, we have to write KVL or <a href="../kirchhoff-current-law-and-kirchhoff-voltage-law/index.html">Kirchhoff Voltage Law</a> for every possible mesh in a mesh network. In these equations, there may be some known terms and there may be some unknown terms. By solving these equations, we can derive the unknown terms. <strong>Mesh analysis</strong> is one of the simplest and easiest techniques of solving network.</p>
<p>By applying KVL &rArr; &sum;V = 0 in every closed loop in a circuit. That means, arithmetic sum of total <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> gains and drops in a closed loop in a circuit is zero.</p>
<p>Let's consider a network having a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html">voltage source</a> (here it is  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  ) of 6 V across which two series combinations <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s of R<sub>1</sub> = 4 &Omega;, R<sub>2</sub> = 2 &Omega; and R<sub>3</sub> = 1 &Omega;, R<sub>4</sub> = 5 &Omega; respectively are connected as shown in the figure - 1. Now we will discuss the mesh technique in step by step manner for the example given in the figure - 1 for better understanding the method.<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mesh3.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mesh3.gif" alt="Mesh Analysis" width="480" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-237" /></a></p>
<h5>Step - 1</h5>
<p>As we have explained earlier that every complete network is mesh network, so for <strong>mesh analysis</strong> first we have to identify the possible meshes in that network. There are two meshes i.e. mesh -1 formed by R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, V and mesh - 2 formed by V, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>.<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mesh4.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mesh4.gif" alt="mesh analysis" width="480" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-238" /></a></p>
<h5>Step - 2</h5>
<p>Now choose two mesh <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>s one for mesh - 1 and say it is I<sub>1</sub> and other is for mesh - 2 and say it is I<sub>2</sub>. The direction of these two <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>s may be taken as arbitrary but it is better convention to choice both  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in same direction. Here we have chosen both currents I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> are in clockwise direction.<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mesh5.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mesh5.gif" alt="mesh analysis" width="480" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-239" /></a></p>
<h5>Step - 3</h5>
<p>Next step is to identify the polarities of each element connected in the mesh. The polarities of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops must be positive at upstream end and negative at downstream end of a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. Generally we mark + at terminal where <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> enters in the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. The  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  polarities should be as orientations given in the diagram<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mesh6.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mesh6.gif" alt="mesh analysis" width="480" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-240" /></a></p>
<h5>Step - 4</h5>
<p>Now for <strong>mesh analysis</strong> we will apply <a href="../kirchhoff-current-law-and-kirchhoff-voltage-law/index.html">Kirchoff's <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> law</a> and generate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equation for each mesh in that mesh network.</p>
<p>Here the mesh equations are-</p>
<p><center><img src="../equations/smma-01-04-06-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
<center><img src="../equations/smma-02-04-06-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
After putting the values of R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub> and V in the equations (i) and (ii) we get,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/smma-03-04-06-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
<center><img src="../equations/smma-04-04-06-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
The value of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> I<sub>1</sub> becomes negative which implies that the actual direction of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the circuit was opposite of our assumption of mesh  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  for mesh - 1. As the value of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>2</sub> is positive, that means the direction of actual <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> and assumed mesh  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  match.<br />
