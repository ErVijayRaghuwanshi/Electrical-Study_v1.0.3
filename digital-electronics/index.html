We know there are two types of signals, one is analog or continuous signal and the second one is Digital or discrete signal. So the science or field of research in the area of engineering is termed as Analog and <strong>Digital Electronics</strong> respectively. Now coming to the area of <strong>Digital Electronics</strong>, it is essential to understand wide range of applications from industrial electronics to the fields of communication, from micro embedded systems to military equipment. The main and perhaps the most revolutionary advantage of Digital electronics is the decrease in size and the improvement in technology. </p>
<p>We have chosen to discuss various topics of Digital Electronics from the very fundamentals of this subject such as Number systems, logic circuits going deep into those topics, like discussing various types of number systems, which we should use and how, inter relation among those number systems to the somewhat tougher concepts of Digital Electronics like TTL, PMOS- NMOS logic, Flip Flops etc. to get an idea about the whole subject. </p>
<p>All the topics of the related articles have been amply presented by diagrams, designs, tables and examples to make every topic understandable as much as possible. The topics are written in such a manner that if one go through them he will grasp the very basic idea at first attempt and further reading will enhance the technical knowledge.<br />
Now let us inform you what we have included in the topics of Digital Electronics, as we have already discussed we have started from the very basic topics of Digital Electronics like Number system. Then we have discussed the extension of number system like various types of number system, interrelation among different types of number systems making oneself absolutely comfortable with the fundamentals of Number system. Then we have enlightened the very important field of Digital Electronics i.e. <a href="../binary-arithmetic/index.html"  >Binary Arithmetic</a> and <a href="../boolean-algebra-theorems-and-laws-of-boolean-algebra/index.html"  >Boolean algebra</a>. And we have discussed about them in elaborated manner. From <a href="../binary-addition/index.html"  >binary addition</a>, <a href="../binary-subtraction/index.html"  >binary subtraction</a>, <a href="../binary-multiplication/index.html"  >binary multiplication</a> and <a href="../binary-division/index.html"  >binary division</a> to the basics of <a href="../boolean-algebra-theorems-and-laws-of-boolean-algebra/index.html"  >Boolean algebra</a>. After that we have written topics about various types of codes such as <a href="../ascii-code/index.html"  >ASCII code</a>, <a href="../gray-code-binary-to-gray-code-and-that-to-binary-conversion/index.html"  >Gray Code</a>, <a href="../hamming-code/index.html"  >Hamming code</a> which have made the input output format very easy. Then various types of logic gates (<a href="../logical-and-gate/index.html"  >AND gate</a>, <a href="../logical-or-gate/index.html"  >OR gate</a>, <a href="../not-gate/index.html"  >NOT gate</a>, <a href="../nand-gate/index.html"  >NAND gate</a>, NOR gate, <a href="../exclusive-or-gate/index.html"  >EX-OR gate</a>) have been discussed in an elaborated manner with diagrams, explanations and <a href="../truth-table/index.html"  >truth tables</a> to make each one of them very easy to understand. These may be classified as the fundamentals of Digital Electronics without which the subject cannot be understood at all. So after discussing about them we have gone deep into the subject. Topics like TTL, Logic Families, various MOS gates, Flip Flops (J-K, D, T etc.) have been discussed.</p>
</p>
<p>The sole purpose of introducing this subject in our <a href="../index.html"  >Electrical Engineering</a> website is because now days all the engineering streams are interrelated and the knowledge of Digital Electronics is very much essential for an electrical Engineer and we have tried our best to make oneself familiar with the subject technically as much as possible. </p>
