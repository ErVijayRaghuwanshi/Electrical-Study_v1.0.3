<p><strong>Thermistor</strong> is a temperature sensitive device. If the temperature varies, then the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the <strong>thermistor</strong> either increases or decreases. By using this property, we can use it as a temperature sensor. <strong>Thermistor Thermometer</strong> is a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> type thermometers. But, it differs from RTD or <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> Temperature Detector. In thermistors, the <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> materials are used, while RTD has pure metals. The <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> materials are prepared from the oxides of chromium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and sulphides of iron, aluminium or copper. Because of semiconductor, <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the thermistor varies significantly with temperature, more than the normal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. <strong>Thermistor thermometers</strong> have high sensitivity but it has nonlinear characteristics. This can be understood from the following example; for a typical 2000 &Omega; thermistor, the change in temperature at 25&deg;C is 80&Omega;/&deg;C, whereas for a 2000&Omega; platinum RTD, the change in temperature at 25&deg;C is 7&Omega;/&deg;C. </p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Thermistor">Types of Thermistor</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_13291" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 297px"><img src="../images/characteristics-of-ntc-thermistor.gif" alt="characteristics of ntc thermistor" width="287" height="276" class="size-full wp-image-13291" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fig - 1 (a)</p></div><br />
Thermistors are classified into two types. They are,<br />
	Negative Temperature Co-efficient Thermistors,<br />
	Positive Temperature Co-efficient Thermistors.<br />
The fig.1(a) &#038; fig.1(b) shows their <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>-temperature characteristics curve. </p>
<p>The characteristics of NTC thermistor is more common, which is shown in fig.1(a). In NTC thermistor, the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> decreases as the temperature increases, according to the following expression.<br />
<img src="../equations/thermistor-equation-1.gif" alt=""/><br />
<div id="attachment_13301" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 295px"><img src="../images/characteristics-of-ptc-thermistor.gif" alt="characteristics of ptc thermistor" width="285" height="277" class="size-full wp-image-13301" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fig - 1 (b)</p></div><br />
Where, R<sub>T</sub> is the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> at temperature T (K)<br />
R<sub>0</sub> is the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> at temperature T<sub>0</sub> (K)<br />
T<sub>0</sub> is the reference temperature, normally 25&deg;C<br />
&beta; is a constant, its value is decided by the characteristics of the material, the nominal value is taken as 4000. The people are always required that the &beta; should be higher. If the value of &beta; is high, then the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> – temperature relationship will be very good. Then the sensitivity of the thermistor also increases. That means for the same raise of temperature, we can get the higher variations in the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. This is very good property to make any instrument with greater sensitivity.<br />
	From the expression (1), we can obtain the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> temperature co-efficient. This is nothing but the expression for sensitivity.<br />
<img src="../equations/thermistor-equation-2.gif" alt=""/><br />
	It clearly shows that the αT has negative sign. That indicates the negative <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>-temperature characteristics of the NTC thermistor.<br />
	If &beta; = 4000 K &#038; T = 298 K, then the &alpha;<sub>T</sub> = - 0.0045/&deg;K. This is much higher than the sensitivity of platinum RTD.  So, it helps to measure the very small difference if the temperature. </p>
</p>
<p>	However, alternative forms of heavily doped thermistors are now available (at high cost) that have a positive temperature co-efficient. The expression (1) is such that it is not possible to make a linear approximation to the curve over even a small temperature range, and hence the thermistors is very definitely a non-linear sensor. </p>
<h2 id="Construction-of-Thermistor-Thermometer">Construction of Thermistor Thermometer</h2>
<p><img src="../images/thermistor1.jpg" alt="thermistor" width="300" height="285" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13309" />Basically in a thermistor, two or more <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> powders are mixed with a binder to form a slurry. After getting the slurry from the previous process, small drops of that slurry is formed over the lead wires. For drying purpose, we have to put it into a sintering furnace. During this process, that slurry (metallic oxides) will shrink onto the lead wires and it helps to make an electrical connection.  Then, that processed metallic oxide is sealed by putting a glass coating on it. If we put the glass coating, it gives the water proof property to the thermistors and due to that, it improves the stability of them.    	</p>
<h3 id="Bridge-Circuit-Formation-using-Thermistor">Bridge Circuit Formation using Thermistor</h3>
<p>	Now, the thermistor is an active element in bridge circuit. If we want to measure the temperature, we need to calculate the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of bridge circuit and then we have to use one calibration equation to fine the actual temperature level. If the bridge is unbalanced, then we must use the calibration equation for that output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to find the temperature. For better calibration, we are using the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to frequency converter circuit which is connected across the output of the bridge. Based on the frequency and signal condition, it gives better resolution to get the temperature value. This is one of the efficient method to find temperature using thermistor. </p>
<p><img src="../images/bridge-circuit.gif" alt="thermistor bridge circuit" width="367" height="225" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13297" /><br />
Assume, initially the bridge is balanced, when R<sub>T</sub>R<sub>1</sub> = R<sub>2</sub>R<sub>3</sub>. If the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are fixed value <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s, then the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> can be varied due to change in <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> RT. The expressions are as follows;<br />
<img src="../equations/thermistor-equation-3.gif" alt=""/><br />
Now, the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a><br />
<img src="../equations/thermistor-equation-4.gif" alt=""/><br />
This is present temperature only. But, after sometimes due to the temperature changes the thermistor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> value will also change. So, now the new value of R<sub>T</sub> = R<sub>T</sub> + &Delta;R<sub>T</sub>. Here &Delta;R<sub>T</sub> is known as change in <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> due to temperature changes.<br />
Now, the new output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a><br />
<img src="../equations/thermistor-equation-5.gif" alt=""/><br />
This is how the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> varies with change in <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Features-of-Thermistor-Thermometer">Features of Thermistor Thermometer</h3>
<p>The typical size of a thermistor is 0.125mm to 1.5 mm. The useful range of temperature that we can get in thermistor is -100&deg;C to +300&deg;C. Commercial available thermistors have the nominal values of 1K, 2K, 10K, 20K, 100K, etc. This values indicates that the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> value at the temperature of 25&deg;C.  </p>
<p>The thermistors are available in different models: bead type, rod type, disc type, etc. However, the major advantages of thermistors are their relatively low cost and their small size.</p>
<p>This size advantage means that the time constant of thermistors operated in sheaths is small, although the size reduction also decreases its heat dissipation capability and so makes the self-heating effect greater. This effect can permanently damage the thermistor.  In consequence, thermistors have to be operated at generally lower  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  levels than <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> thermometers and so the measurement sensitivity is less. </p>
