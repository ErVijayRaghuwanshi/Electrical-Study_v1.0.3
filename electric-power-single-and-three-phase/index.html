<h2 id="complex-power">Complex Power</h2>
<p>It is very conceptual and essential to understand. For establishing the expression of <strong>complex power</strong>, we have to first consider a single phase network that's <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> can be represented in complex form as V.e<sup>j&alpha;</sup> and I.e<sup>j&beta;</sup>. Where &alpha; and &beta; are angles that <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> vector and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  vector subtend with respect to some reference axis respectively. The active power and reactive power can be calculated by finding the product of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> to conjugate of electric current.</p>
<p>That means,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/cparap-08-06-14-01.gif" alt=""></center><br />
<center><img src="../equations/cparap-08-06-14-02.gif" alt=""></center><br />
This (&alpha; &minus; &beta;) is nothing but the angle between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>, hence that is phase difference between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> which is normally denoted as &phi;.</p>
</p>
<p>Therefore the above equation cab be re-written as,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/cparap-08-06-14-03.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Where P = VIcos&phi; and Q = VIsin&phi;.</p>
<p>This quantity S is called the <strong>complex power</strong>.</p>
<p>The magnitude of complex power i.e. |S| = (P<sup>2</sup> + Q<sup>2</sup>)<sup>&frac12;</sup> is known as the <strong>apparent power</strong> and its unit is volt-ampere. This quantity is a product of absolute value of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>. Again absolute value of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is directly related to heating effect as per Joule's law of heating. Hence, rating of an electrical machine is normally determined by its apparent power carrying capability within allowable temperature limit.</p>
<p>It is noted that in the equation of <strong>complex power</strong>, the term Q [ = VIsin&phi; ] is positive when &phi; [= (&alpha; &minus; &beta;)] is positive that is,  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  lags the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> which means the load is inductive in nature. Again Q is negative when &phi; is negative; that is <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> leads the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> that means the load is capacitive.</p>
<h2 id="single-phase-power">Single Phase Power</h2>
<p>A single phase <a href="../electrical-power-transmission-system-and-network/index.html" title="Electrical Power Transmission System">electrical transmission system</a> is practically not available, but still we should know the basic concept of <strong>single phase power</strong> first before going through modern three phase power system. Before going to details about single phase power, let's try to understand different parameters of <a href="../index.html" title="Electrical Engineering and Technology">electrical power system</a>. Three basic parameters of <a href="../index.html" title="Electrical Engineering and Technology">electrical power system</a> are <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail">electrical resistance</a>, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance">inductance</a> and <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitance</a>.</p>
<h4 id="resistance">Resistance</h4>
<p>The resistance is an inherent property of any material, due to which it resists the flow of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  by obstructing the movement of electrons through it due to collision with stationary atoms. The heat generated due to this process is dissipated and known as ohmic power loss. While  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> ">resistor</a>, there will not be any phase difference between the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>, which means  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> are in same phase; the phase angle between them is zero. If I <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> flows through an <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> R for t seconds, then total energy consumed by the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is I<sup>2</sup>.R.t. This energy is known as <strong>active energy</strong> and corresponding power is known as <strong>active power</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="inductance">Inductance</h4>
<p><a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance">Inductance</a> is the property by virtue of which an <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance">inductor</a> stores energy in <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a></a> during positive half cycle and gives away this energy during negative half cycle of single phase power supply. If a <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> 'I' flows through a coil of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance">inductance</a> L Henry, the energy stored in the coil in form of <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a></a> is given by<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp1.gif" alr=""/></center><br />
The power associated with an <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance">inductance</a> is <strong>reactive power</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="capacitance">Capacitance</h4>
<p><a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">Capacitance</a> is the property by virtue of which a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance?

The energy stored between two parallel metallic plates of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >electric potential difference</a> V and <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance?

<center><img src="../equations/spp2.gif" alr=""/></center><br />
This energy is stored in form of <a href="../static-electric-field/index.html" >static electric field</a>. The power associated with a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a>  is also <strong>reactive power</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="active-power-and-reactive-power">Active Power and Reactive Power</h2>
<p>Let us consider a <strong>single phase power</strong> circuit in which <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> lags behind the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by an angle &phi;. </p>
<p>Let the instantaneous <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >electric potential difference</a> v = V<sub>m</sub>.sin&omega;t </p>
<p>Then the instantaneous <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> can be expressed as i = I<sub>m</sub>. sin(&omega;t - &phi;).</p>
<p>Where, V<sub>m</sub> and I<sub>m</sub> are the maximum values of sinusoidally varying <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >electric potential difference</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> respectively.</p>
<p>The instantaneous power of the circuit is given by<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp3.gif" alr=""/></center></p>
<h2 id="active-power">Active Power</h2>
<h3 id="resistive-power">Resistive Power</h3>
<p>Let's take the condition first where the single phase power circuit is fully resistive in nature, that means the phase angle between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> i.e. &phi; = 0 and hence,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp4.gif" alr=""/></center><br />
<img src="../images01/active-power.gif" alt="active power" title="Active Power"/><br />
From the above equation it is clear that, whatever may be the value of &omega;t the value of cos2&omega;t cannot be greater than 1; hence the value of p cannot be negative. The value of p is always positive irrespective of the instantaneous direction of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> v and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  i, that means the energy is flowing in its conventional direction, i.e. from source to load and p is the rate of energy consumption by the load and this is called <strong>active power</strong>. As this power is consumed due to resistive effect of an electrical circuit, hence sometimes it is also called resistive power.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-power">Reactive Power</h2>
<h3 id="inductive-power">Inductive Power</h3>
<p>Now consider a situation when the single phase power circuit is fully inductive, that means the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> lags behind the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by an angle &phi; = + 90&deg;. Putting &phi; = + 90&deg;<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp5.gif" alr=""/></center><br />
<img src="../images01/inductive-reactive-power.gif" alt="inductive power" title="Inductive Reactive Power"/><br />
In the above expression, it is found that the power is flowing in alternative directions. From 0&deg; to 90&deg; it will have negative half cycle, from 90&deg; to 180&deg; it will have positive half cycle, from 180&deg; to 270&deg; it will have again negative half cycle and from 270&deg; to 360&deg; it will have again positive half cycle. Therefore this power is alternative in nature with a frequency, double of supply frequency. As the power is flowing in alternating direction i.e. from source to load in one half cycle and from load to source in next half cycle, the average value of this power is zero. Therefore this power does not do any useful work. This power is known as <strong>reactive power</strong>. As the above explained reactive power expression is related to fully inductive circuit, this power is also called <strong>inductive power</strong>.</p>
<p>This can be concluded as if the circuit is purely inductive, energy will be stored as <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a></a> energy during positive half cycle and give away during negative half cycle and rate at which this energy changes, expressed as <strong>reactive power</strong> of <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance">inductor</a> or simply <strong>inductive power</strong> and this power will have equal positive and negative cycle and the net value will be zero.</p>
<h3 id="capacitive-power">Capacitive Power</h3>
<p>Let us now consider the single phase power circuit is fully capacitive, that is the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> leads the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by 90&deg;, therefore &phi; = - 90&deg;.<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp6.gif" alr=""/></center><br />
<img src="../images01/capacitive-reactive-power.gif" alt="capacitive power" title="Capacitive Reactive Power"/><br />
Hence in the expression of <strong>capacitive power</strong>, it is also found that the power is flowing in alternative directions. From 0&deg; to 90&deg; it will have positive half cycle, from 90&deg; to 180&deg; it will have negative half cycle, from 180&deg; to 270&deg; it will have again positive half cycle and from 270&deg; to 360&deg; it will have again negative  half cycle. So this power is also alternative in nature with a frequency, double of supply frequency. Therefore, as inductive power, the capacitive power does not do any useful work. This power is also a reactive power.</p>
<h3 id="active-component-and-reactive-component-of-power">Active Component and Reactive Component of Power</h3>
<p>The <strong>power equation</strong> can be re-written as<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp7.gif" alr=""/></center><br />
This above expression has two consonants; first one is V<sub>m</sub>. I<sub>m</sub>.cos&phi;(1 – cos2&omega;t) which never goes negative as because value of (1 – cos2&omega;t) always greater or equal zero but cannot have a negative value.<br />
<img src="../images01/active-reactive-power.gif" alt="active power and reactive power" title="Active and Reactive Power"/><br />
This portion of the <a href="../single-phase-power-calculation-equation-and-formula/index.html" >single phase power equation</a> represents the expression of reactive power which is alternatively known as real power or true power. The average of this power will obviously have some non zero value means, the power physically does some useful work and that is why this power is also called real power or sometimes it is referred as true power. This portion of the power equation represents the reactive power which is alternatively known as real power or true power.</p>
<p>Second term is V<sub>m</sub>. I<sub>m</sub>.sin&phi;sin2&omega;t which will have negative and positive cycles. Hence, average of this component is zero. This component is known as reactive component as it travels back and forth on the line without doing any useful work.</p>
<p>Both <strong>active power and reactive power</strong> have same dimensions of watts but to emphasize the fact that reactive component represents a non-active power, it is measured in terms of volt-amperes reactive or in short VAR. </p>
<p>Single phase power refers to the distribution system in which; all the voltages vary in unison. It can be generated simply by rotating a moving coil in a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a></a> or by moving field around a stationary coil. The alternating <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and alternating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  so produced, thus referred to as single phase <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>. Different types of circuits show different response to the application of sinusoidal input. We will consider all type of circuits one by one that include <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> only, <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance?

<h2 id="single_phase_power_equation_for_purely_resistive_circuit">Single Phase Power Equation for Purely Resistive Circuit</h2>
<p>Let's examine <strong>single phase power calculation</strong> for purely resistive circuit. Circuit consisting of pure ohmic <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is across a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" >voltage source</a> of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V, is shown below in figure(a).<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp-1.GIF" alt=""/></center><br />
Where, V(t) = instantaneous voltage.<br />
V<sub>m</sub> = maximum value of voltage.<br />
&omega; = angular velocity in radians/seconds.<br />
<img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/resistive-circuit-300x214.png" alt="resistive circuit" width="300" height="214" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5664" /><br />
According to <a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html" title="Ohm’s Law">Ohm’s law</a> ,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp-2.GIF" alt=""/></center><br />
Substituting value of V(t) in above equation we get,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp-3.GIF" alt=""/></center><br />
From equations (1.1) and (1.5) it is clear that V(t) and I<sub>R</sub> are in phase. Thus in case of pure ohmic <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, there is no phase difference between voltages and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>, i.e. they are in phase as shown in figure (b).<br />

Instantaneous power,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp-4.GIF" alt=""/></center><br />
From <strong>single phase power equation</strong> (1.8) it is clear that power consist of two terms, one constant part i.e.<br />

and another a fluctuating part i.e.<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spp-6.GIF" alt=""/></center><br />
That's value is zero for the full cycle. Thus power through pure ohmic <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is given as and is shown in fig(c).<br />

<h2 id="three-phase-power-definition">Three Phase Power Definition</h2>
<p>It is found that generation of <strong>three phase power</strong> is more economical than generation of single phase power.

That means; each <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage Theory">voltage</a> waveform has phase difference of 120&deg; to other <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> waveform and each  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  waveform has phase difference of 120&deg; to other  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  waveform. <strong>Three phase power definition</strong> states that in an electrical system, three individual single phase powers are carried out by three separate power circuits. The voltages of these three powers are ideally 120&deg; apart from each other in time-phase. Similarly, the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>s of these three powers are also ideally 120&deg; apart from each other.

<p>There are many reasons due to which this power is more preferable than single phase power. </p>

Which is time dependent function. Whereas <strong>three phase power equation</strong> is<br />
<center><img src="../equations/tppe-02-20-05-14.gif" alt=""></center></p>
<p>Which is time independent constant function. Hence the single phase power is pulsating. This generally does not effect the low rating motor but in larger rated motor, it produces excessive vibration. So three phase power is more preferable for high tension power load.</li>
<li>The rating of a three phase machine 1.5 times greater than that of same size single phase machine.</li>

<p>The above expression of power shows that the total instantaneous power is constant and equal to three times of the real power per phase. In case of <a href="../single-phase-power-calculation-equation-and-formula/index.html">single phase power expression</a> we found that there are both reactive power and active power components, but in case of three phase power expression, the instantaneous power is constant. Actually in three phase system, the <a href="../reactive-power-and-its-compensation-in-transmission-lines/index.html">reactive power</a> in each individual phase is not zero but sum of them at any instant is zero.</p>
<p><strong>Reactive power</strong> is the form of magnetic energy, flowing per unit time in an electric circuit. Its unit is VAR (Volt Ampere Reactive). This power can never be used in an AC circuit. However, in an <a href="../electrical-dc-series-and-parallel-circuit/index.html">electrical DC circuit</a> it can be converted into heat as when a charged <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> or <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance">inductor</a> is connected across a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>, the energy stored in the element get converted to heat. Our power system operates on AC system and most of the loads used in our daily life, are inductive or capacitive, therefore <strong>reactive power</strong> is a very important concept from electrical perspective.</p>
<p>The <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a> of any equipment determines the amount of <strong>reactive power</strong> it requires. It is the ratio of real or true power to the total apparent power required by an electrical appliance. These powers can be defined as,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/rp-08-06-14-01.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Where &theta; is the phase difference between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and cos&theta; is <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a> of the load.<br />
<center><img src="../equations/rp-08-06-14-02.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Reactive power is always present in a circuit where there is a phase difference between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in that circuit, such as all our domestic loads are inductive. So, there is a phase difference between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>, and the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> lags behind the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by certain angle in time domain. An inductive component takes the lagging reactive power and a capacitive component absorbs the leading reactive power, here lagging reactive power refers to magnetic energy and leading reactive power refers to electrostatic energy.</p>
<p>In a typical AC circuit, such as <a href="../rl-circuit-transfer-function-time-constant-rl-circuit-as-filter/index.html">RL circuit</a> (Resistive + Inductive) or RC circuit (Resistive + Capacitive), the reactive power is taken from the supply for a half cycle and returned to the supply for next half cycle. For example power consumed for an RL load is derived as:<br />
<center><img src="../equations/rp-08-06-14-03.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Then power is given by,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/rp-08-06-14-04.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Here Q<sub>1</sub>sin2&omega;t is reactive power that's average value is zero, this shows that reactive power is never utilized.</p>
<h2 id="Use-of-Reactive-Power">Use of Reactive Power</h2>
<p>In an electrical machine, the energy conversion needs a magnetic domain to convert its form. In an <a href="../electrical-motor-types-classification-and-history-of-motor/index.html">electrical motor</a>, the required magnetic domain is produced by reactive power which it takes from the supply.Today almost every electrical load needs reactive power to run in spite of real power. Even in an <a href="../what-is-transformer-definition-working-principle-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical transformer</a> which is the basic unit of power system, primary input <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> is lagging as it takes lagging VAR to magnetize its core and transfer the power through mutual induction.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-power-in-transmission-lines">Reactive Power in Transmission Lines</h2>
<p>In an <a href="../performance-of-transmission-line/index.html">electrical power transmission line</a>, the flow of reactive power in the line decides the receiving end voltage. Managing <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level at the receiving end is very important, as higher <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> can damage the consumer's equipment and there will be a great loss. In many cases, we see sudden <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rise or fall due to lightning or due to any fault on the healthy phases and in any case damage to the equipment occurs. Let us see how <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> depends on reactive power.</p>
<p>The receiving end reactive power is given by,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/rp-08-06-14-05.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Where &theta; is the power angle which is kept very low due to stability reasons, X<sub>l</sub> is the reactance of the transmission line, V<sub>s</sub> is the sending end <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and V<sub>r</sub> is the receiving end voltage.</p>
<p>So Q<sub>r</sub> becomes,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/rp-08-06-14-06.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now equation is formed as,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/rp-08-06-14-07.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Solving we get,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/rp-08-06-14-08.gif" alt=""></center><br />
<snap class="Green">Note: We did not take negative sign as then V<sub>r</sub> will become zero when Q<sub>r</sub> is zero which is not possible.</snap></p>
<p>Let Q<sub>1</sub>  be the reactive power demanded by the load at the receiving end and Q<sub>2</sub> be the reactive power supply from the generating or sending end. Then Q<sub>r</sub> is (Q<sub>1</sub> - Q<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<h4><u>Case - 1</u></h5>
<p>When supply Q<sub>2</sub> is equal to demand Q<sub>1</sub> then V<sub>s</sub> = V<sub>r</sub>, the receiving end <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> will be equal to sending end voltage, which is desirable.</p>
<h4><u>Case - 2</u></h4>
<p>When demand is more and supply is less, Q<sub>r</sub> becomes negative. And so the receiving end <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> becomes less than sending end voltage.</p>
<h4><u>Case - 3</u></h4>
<p>When demand is less, supply is high, Q<sub>r</sub> becomes positive. Thus, the receiving end <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> becomes greater than sending end <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> which is very dangerous.</p>
<p>In this way, we saw how <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (and its level management) which is very basic requirement of any electrical load; depends on reactive power. During the daytime, the demand for reactive power increases, therefore <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> dip occurs. On the other hand, during morning time, demand for reactive power is less, so rise in <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level occurs. To maintain the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level we need to make Q<sub>1</sub> = Q<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-power-compensation">Reactive Power Compensation</h2>
<p>As already discussed excess of reactive power as well as its scarcity should be monitored. For this purpose, compensation is done by using various devices. Here the reactor absorbs excess reactive power whereas the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> supplies for makeup of reactive power in cases of high demand.</p>
<p>For low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a> loads, the reactive power demand is very high. Therefore, we need to increase the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> using <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank. This reduces the var demand by supplying the appropriate amount of reactive power to the load. </p>
<p>Other methods include use of shunt capacitor, synchronous phase modifiers, on-load tap changing transformer and shunt reactor.</p>
<p>An overexcited <a href="../synchronous-motor-working-principle/index.html">synchronous motor</a> is used in shunt with the load. It serves as a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html">capacitor</a> and is also called synchronous condenser. A shunt reactor is used for the reduction of <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a>. In the on-load tap changing transformers, turns ratio is adjusted accordingly to maintain the desirable <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level as the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltage difference</a> between the sending and receiving end determines the reactive power.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the expression given for the reactive power(Q) needed to increase the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a> from cos&theta;<sub>1</sub> to cos&theta;<sub>2</sub> is given as,<br />

Where P is real power demand of the load (in watts).</p>
<p>In case the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a> is to be decreased from cos&theta;<sub>2</sub> to cos&theta;<sub>1</sub>, the reactive power which must be absorbed by the shunt reactor at the load end is given by,<br />
