<p>It is interesting to know that the first A.C. drive (400 HP) based on thyratron cycloconverter-fed WRIM was installed in 1932 by F.E. Alexanderson of General Electric in the Logan Power Station of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. From then industrial drives have evolved rapidly by dedicated effort of many scientists and engineers all over the world resulting in development of advanced drive technology such as <strong>Variable Frequency Drive</strong>(<strong>VFD</strong>). <strong>VFD</strong> is a power electronics based device which converts a basic fixed frequency, fixed <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> sine wave power (line power) to a variable frequency, variable output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> used to control speed of induction motor(s). It regulates the speed of a three phase induction motor by controlling the frequency and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the power supplied to the motor.<br />
<img src='1.png' id="latexN_s%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B%5Cfrac%7B120f%7D%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='N_s\;=\;\frac{120f}{p}' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='N_s\;=\;\frac{120f}{p}' /><br />
Since the number of pole is constant the speed N<sub>s</sub> can be varied by continuously changing frequency.</p>
<div id="attachment_8810" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 601px"><img src="../images/vfd-11.gif" alt=" Variable Frequency Drive" width="591" height="381" class="size-full wp-image-8810" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Generalized Motor Control through Variable Frequency Drive</p></div>
<h2 id="Working-of-Variable-Frequency-Drive">Working of Variable Frequency Drive</h2>
<p>Any <strong>Variable Frequency Drive</strong> or <strong>VFD</strong> incorporates following three stages for controlling a three phase induction motor.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="Rectifier-Stage">Rectifier Stage</h3>
<p>A full-wave power <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> based solid-state rectifier converts three-phase 50 Hz power from a standard 220, 440 or higher utility supply to either fixed or adjustable DC voltage. The system may include transformers for high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> system.</p>
<h3 id="Inverter-Stage">Inverter Stage</h3>
<p>Power electronic switches such as IGBT, GTO or <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> switch the DC power from rectifier on and off to produce a  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> waveform at the required new frequency. Presently most of the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  inverters (VSI) use pulse width modulation (PWM) because the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> waveform at output in this scheme is approximately a sine wave. Power Electronic switches such as IGBT; GTO etc. switch DC <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> at high speed, producing a series of short-width pulses of constant amplitude. Output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is varied by varying the gain of the inverter. Output frequency is adjusted by changing the number of pulses per half cycle or by varying the period for each time cycle. The resulting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in an induction motor simulates a sine wave of the desired output frequency. The high speed switching action of a PWM inverter results in less waveform distortion and hence decreases harmonic losses.</p>
<h3 id="Control-System">Control System</h3>
<p>Its function is to control output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> i.e. <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> vector of inverter being fed to motor and maintain a constant ratio of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to frequency (V/Hz). It consists of an electronic circuit which receives feedback information from the driven motor and adjusts the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or frequency to the desired values. Control system may be based on SPWM (Sine Wave PWM), SVPWM (Space Vector modulated PWM) or some soft computing based algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="Induction-Motor-Characteristic-under-Variable-Frequency-Drive">Induction Motor Characteristic under Variable Frequency Drive</h3>
<p>In an induction motor <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> induced in stator, E is proportional to the product of the slip frequency and the air gap flux. The terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> can be considered proportional to the product of the slip frequency and flux, if stator drop is neglected. Any reduction in the supply frequency without a change in the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> causes an increase in the air gap flux which will cause magnetic saturation of motor. Also the torque capability of motor is decreased. Hence while controlling a motor with the help of VFD or Variable Frequency Drive we always keep the V/f ratio constant.</p>
<p>Now define variable ‘K’ as,</p>
<p><img src='2.png' id="latexK%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B%5Cfrac%7Bf%7D%7Bf_%7Brated%7D%7D&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='K\;=\;\frac{f}{f_{rated}}' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='K\;=\;\frac{f}{f_{rated}}' /></p>
<p>For operation below K < 1 i.e. below rated frequency we have constant flux operation. For this we maintain constant magnetization  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>m</sub> for all operating points. </p>
<p>For K > 1 i.e. above rated frequency we maintain terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> Vrated constant. In this field is weakened in the inverse ratio of per unit frequency ‘K’.</p>
<p>For values of K = 1 we have constant torque operation and above that we have constant power application.<br />

<h3 id="Merits-of-using-Variable-Frequency-Drives">Merits of using Variable Frequency Drives</h3>
<h4 id="Energy-Saving">Energy Saving</h4>
<p>Primary function of VFD in industry is to provide smooth control along with energy savings. The variable speed motor drive system is more efficient than all other flow control methods including valves, turbines, hydraulic transmissions, dampers, etc. Energy cost savings becomes more pronounced in variable-torque ID fan and pump applications, where the load’s torque and power is directly proportional to the square and cube of the speed respectively.</p>
<h4 id="Increased-Reliability">Increased  Reliability</h4>
<p>Adjustable speed motor-drive systems are more reliable than traditional mechanical approaches such as using valves, gears, louvers or turbines to control speed and flow. Unlike mechanical control system they don’t have any moving parts hence they are highly reliable.</p>
<h4 id="Speed-Variations">Speed Variations</h4>
<p>  Beyond energy saving, applications such as crushers, conveyors and grinding mills can use the motor and VFD’s packages to provide optimal speed variations. In some crucial applications, the operating speed range can be wide, which a motor supplied with a constant frequency power source cannot provide. In the case of conveyors and mills, a VFD and motor system can even provide a “crawl” speed foe maintenance purposes eliminating the need for additional drives.</p>
<h4 id="Soft-Starting">Soft Starting</h4>
<p>  When Variable Frequency Drives start large motors, the drawbacks associated with large inrush  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  i.e. starting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  (winding stress, winding overheating and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> dip on connected bus) is eliminated. This reduces chances of insulation or winding damage and provides extended motor life. </p>
<h4 id="Extended-Machine-Life-and-Less-Maintenance">Extended Machine Life and Less Maintenance</h4>
<p>The VFD’s greatly reduce wear to the motor, increase life of the equipment and decrease maintenance costs. Due to optimal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and frequency control it offers better protection to the   motor from issues such as electro thermal overloads, phase faults, over voltage, under <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> etc. When we start a motor (on load) with help of a VFD, the motor is not subjected to “instant shock” hence there is less wear and tear of belt, gear and pulley system.</p>
<h4 id="High-Power-Factor">High Power Factor</h4>
<p>Power converted to rotation, heat, sound, etc. is called active power and is measured in kilowatts (kW). Power that charges builds <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a>s or charges <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> is called reactive power and is measured in kVAR. The vector sum of the kW and the kVAR is the Apparent Power and is measured in KVA. Power factor is the ratio of kW/KVA. Typical AC motors may have a full load <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. As the motor load is reduced, the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> becomes low. The advantage of using VFD’s is that it includes  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> in the DC Bus itself which maintains high <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> on the line side of the Variable Frequency Drive. This eliminates the need of additional expensive <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> banks.</p>
<h4 id="Slip-Power-Recovery">Slip Power Recovery</h4>
<p>The fundamental power given to rotor by stator is called air gap power P<sub>g</sub>. The mechanical power developed is given by<br />
<img src='3.png' id="latexP_m%5C%3B%3D%5C%3BP_g%5C%3B%20-%5C%3B%20sP_g&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='P_m\;=\;P_g\; -\; sP_g' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='P_m\;=\;P_g\; -\; sP_g' /><br />
The term 'sP' is called slip power.<br />
<img src="../images/vfd-3.gif" alt="Slip power recovery Scheme" width="475" height="468" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8814" /><br />
If the slip is very large i.e. speed is low then there is ample waste of power, a common example is kiln drives of cement industry. This power can be saved through slip recovery scheme.In this scheme slip power is first collected through brushes of WRIM. This slip power recovered is then rectified and inverted back to line frequency and is  injected  into supply through coupling transformer.The scheme is shown in figure below.</p>
<h3 id="Applications-of-Variable-Frequency-Drive">Applications of Variable Frequency Drive</h3>
<ol>
<li>They are mostly used in industries for large induction motor (dealing with variable load) whose power rating ranges from few kW to few MW.</li>
<li>Variable Frequency Drive is used in traction system. In India it is being used by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.</li>
<li>They are also used in modern lifts, escalators and pumping systems.</li>
<li>Nowadays they are being also used in energy efficient refrigerators, AC’s and Outside-air Economizers.</li>
