<p>A <strong>capacitor bank</strong> is very essential equipment of an electrical power system. The power required to run all the electrical appliances is the load as useful power is active power. The active power is expressed in KW or MW. The maximum load connected to the electrical power system is mainly inductive in nature such as electrical transformer</a>, <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html">induction motors</a>, <a href="../synchronous-motor-working-principle/index.html">synchronous motor</a>, electric furnaces, fluorescent lighting are all inductive in nature. In addition to these, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of different lines also contributes <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> to the system. Because of these inductances, the system  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  lags behind system voltage. As the lagging angle between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  increases, the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> of the system decreases. As the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a> decreases, for same active power demand the system draws more  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  from source. More  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> causes, more line losses. Poor <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a> causes poor <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulation. So to avoid these difficulties, the <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html">electrical power factor</a> of the system to be improved. As a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> causes  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to lead the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage</a>, capacitive reactance can be used to cancel the inductive reactance of the system.</p>
</p>
<p>The <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> reactance can be used to cancel the inductive reactance of the system.</p>
<p>The <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> reactance is generally applied to the system by using static <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> in shut or series with system. Instead of using a single unit of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> per phase of the system, it is quite effective to use a bank of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> units, in the view of maintenance and erection. This group or bank of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> units is known as <strong>capacitor bank</strong>.</p>
<p>There are mainly two categories of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank according to their connection arrangements.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Shunt capacitor</strong>.</p>
<p>2) Series capacitor.</p>
<p>The Shunt <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> is very commonly used.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-determine-Rating-of-Required-Capacitor-Bank">How to determine Rating of Required Capacitor Bank</h3>
<p>The size of the Capacitor bank can be determined by the following formula :</p>
<p><center><img src='1.png' id="latexQ%5C%3B%3D%5C%3BP%28%5C%3B%5Ctan%20%5Ctheta%20%5C%3B-%5C%3B%5Ctan%20%5Ctheta%20%27%5C%3B%29&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='Q\;=\;P(\;\tan \theta \;-\;\tan \theta '\;)' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='Q\;=\;P(\;\tan \theta \;-\;\tan \theta '\;)' /></center><br />
where Q is required KVAR.</p>
<p>      P is active power in KW.</p>
<p>      cos&theta; is <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> before compensation.</p>
<p>      cos&theta;' <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" title="Electrical Power Factor ">power factor</a> after compensation.</p>
<h2 id="Location-of-Capacitor-Bank">Location of Capacitor Bank</h2>
<p>Theoretically it is always desired to commission a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank nearer to reactive load. This makes transmission of reactive KVARS is removed from a greater part of the network. Moreover if <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> and load are connected simultaneously, during disconnection of load, <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> is also disconnected from rest of the circuit. Hence, there is no question of over compensation. But connecting <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> with each individual load is not practical in the economical point of view. As the size of loads extremely differs for different consumers. So various size of  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> are not always readily available. Hence proper compensation can not be possible at each loading point. Again each load is not connected with system for 24 × 7 hours. So the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> connected to the load also can not be fully utilized.</p>
<p>Hence, capacitor, is not installed at small load but for medium and large loads, <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank can be installed at consumer own premises. Although the inductive loads of medium and large bulk consumers are compensated, but still there would be considerable amount of VAR demand originated from different uncompensated small loads connected to the system. In addition to that, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> of line and transformer also contribute VAR to the system. On viewing of these difficulties, instead of connecting <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> to each load, large <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank is installed at main distribution sub-station or secondary grid sub-station.</p>
<h3 id="Connection-of-Shunt-Capacitor-Bank">Connection of Shunt Capacitor Bank</h3>
<p>The <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank can be connected to the system either in delta or in star. In star connection, the neutral point may be grounded or not depending upon <a href="../protection-of-capacitor-bank/index.html">protection scheme for <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank</a> adopted. In some cases the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank is formed by double star formation.</p>
<p>Generally large <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank in <a href="../electrical-bus-system-and-electrical-substation-layout/index.html" >electrical substation</a> is connected in star.</p>
<p>The grounded star connected bank has some specific advantages, such as,<br />
1)	Reduced recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> on <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" >circuit breaker</a> for normal repetitive <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> switching delay.</p>
<p>2)	Better <a href="../surge-protection-and-lightning-arrester-surge-arrester/index.html">surge protection</a>.</p>
<p>3)	Comparatively reduced over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> phenomenon.</p>
<p>4)	Lesser cost of installation.</p>
<p>5)	In a solidly grounded system the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of all 3-phases of a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank, are fixed and remain unchanged even during 2 phase operation period.</p>
