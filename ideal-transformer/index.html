<h2 id="Definition-of-Ideal-Transformer">Definition of Ideal Transformer</h2>
<p>An <strong>ideal transformer</strong> is an imaginary transformer which does not have any loss in it, means no core losses, copper losses and any other <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/" title="Losses in Transformer">losses in transformer</a>. Efficiency of this transformer is considered as 100%.</p>
<h2 id="Ideal-Transformer-Model">Ideal Transformer Model</h2>
<p><strong>Ideal transformer model</strong> is developed by considering a transformer which does not have any loss. That means the windings of the transformer are purely inductive and the core of transformer is loss free. There is zero <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/">leakage reactance of transformer</a>. As we said, whenever we place a low reluctance core inside the windings, maximum amount of flux passes through this core, but still there is some flux which does not pass through the core but passes through the insulation used in the transformer. This flux does not take part in the transformation action of the transformer. This flux is called <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Leakage-Flux-in-Transformer" title="Leakage Flux in Transformer">leakage flux of transformer</a>. In an <strong>ideal transformer</strong>, this <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Leakage-Flux-in-Transformer" title="Leakage Flux in Transformer">leakage flux</a> is also considered nil. That means, 100% flux passes through the core and links with both the primary and secondary windings of transformer. Although every winding is desired to be purely inductive but it has some <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in it which causes <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop and I<sup>2</sup>R loss in it. In such <strong>ideal transformer model</strong>, the windings are also considered ideal, that means <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the winding is zero.</p>
<p><img src="../images/primary-induced-voltage.gif" alt=" " title="Voltages in Ideal Transformer" class="alignright"></p>
<p>Now if an alternating source <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V<sub>1</sub> is applied in the primary winding of that ideal transformer, there will be a counter self emf E<sub>1</sub> induced in the primary winding which is purely 180° in phase opposition with supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/magnetizing-current.gif" alt="ideal transformer" title="Phasor Diagram of Ideal Transformer"></p>
<p>For developing counter emf E<sub>1</sub> across the primary winding, it draws  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> from the source to produce required magnetizing flux. As the primary winding is purely inductive, that  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  90° lags from the supply voltage. This  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is called magnetizing  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of transformer I<sub>μ</sub>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/secondary-induced-voltage-ideal-transformer.gif" alt="ideal transformer model" title="Ideal Transformer Model" class="alignright"></p>
<p>This alternating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>μ</sub> produces an alternating magnetizing flux Φ which is proportional to that  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> and hence in phase with it. As this flux is also linked with secondary winding through the core of transformer, there will be another emf E<sub>2</sub> induced in the secondary winding, this is mutually induced emf. As the secondary is placed on the same core where the primary winding is placed, the emf induced in the secondary winding of transformer, E<sub>2</sub> is in the phase with primary emf E<sub>1</sub> and in phase opposition with source <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>The above chapter was about a brief discussion about ideal transformer, it has also explained the basic ideal transformer model.</p>
