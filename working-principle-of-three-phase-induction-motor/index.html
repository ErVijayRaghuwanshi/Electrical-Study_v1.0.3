<p>An <a href="../electrical-motor-types-classification-and-history-of-motor/index.html" >electrical motor</a> is such an electromechanical device which converts electrical energy into a mechanical energy. In case of three phase AC operation, most widely used motor is <strong>Three phase induction motor</strong> as this type of motor does not require any starting device or we can say they are self starting induction  motor.                                                                                                                                                                              </p>
<p>For better understanding the <strong>principle of three phase induction motor</strong>, the basic constructional feature of this motor must be known to us. This Motor consists of two major parts:</p>
<p>Stator: <strong>Stator of three phase induction motor</strong> is made up of numbers of slots to construct a 3 phase winding circuit which is connected to 3 phase AC source. The three phase winding are arranged in such a manner in the slots that they produce a rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> after AC is given to them.</p>
<p>Rotor: <strong>Rotor of three phase induction motor</strong> consists of cylindrical laminated core with parallel slots that can carry conductors. Conductors are heavy copper or aluminum bars which fits in each slots &#038; they are short circuited by the end rings. The slots are not exactly made parallel to the axis of the shaft but are slotted a little skewed because this arrangement reduces magnetic humming noise  &#038; can avoid stalling of motor.</p>
<h2 id="Working-of-Three-Phase-Induction-Motor">Working of Three Phase Induction Motor</h2>
<h3 id="Production-of-Rotating-Magnetic-Field">Production of Rotating Magnetic Field</h3>
<p>The stator of the motor consists of overlapping winding offset by an electrical angle of 120&deg;. When the primary winding or the stator is connected to a 3 phase AC source, it establishes a rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> which rotates at the synchronous speed.   </p>
<p><b>Secrets behind the rotation:</b></p>
<p>According to <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html" >Faraday’s law</a>  <q>an emf induced in any circuit is due to the rate of change of <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> linkage through the circuit</q>. As the rotor winding in an <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> are either closed through an external <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> or directly shorted by end ring, and cut the stator rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>, an emf is induced in the rotor copper bar and due to this emf a  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through the rotor conductor.</p>
</p>
<p>Here the relative velocity between the rotating flux and static rotor conductor is the cause of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> generation; hence as per <a href="../lenz-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html" >Lenz's law</a> the rotor will rotate in the same direction to reduce the cause i.e. the relative velocity.</p>
<p>Thus from the <strong>working principle of three phase induction motor</strong> it may observed that the rotor speed should not reach the synchronous speed produced by the stator. If the speeds equals, there would be no such relative velocity, so no emf induction in the rotor, &amp; no  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  would be flowing, and therefore no torque would be generated. Consequently the rotor can not reach at the synchronous speed. The difference between the stator (synchronous speed) and rotor speeds is called the slip. The rotation of the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> in an <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> has the advantage that no electrical connections need to be made to the rotor.</p>
<p>Thus the <strong>three phase induction motor</strong> is:</p>
<p>•	Self-starting.</p>
<p>•	Less armature reaction and brush sparking because of the absence of commutators and brushes that may cause sparks.</p>
<p>•	Robust in construction.</p>
<p>•	Economical.</p>
<p>•	Easier to maintain.<br />
