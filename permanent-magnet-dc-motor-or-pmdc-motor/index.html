In a <a href="../dc-motor-or-direct-current-motor/">dc motor</a>, an armature rotates inside a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a>. Basic <a href="../working-or-operating-principle-of-dc-motor/">working principle of DC motor</a> is based on the fact that whenever a  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  carrying conductor is placed inside a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a>, there will be mechanical force experienced by that conductor. All kinds of <a href="../dc-motor-or-direct-current-motor/">DC motors</a> work in this principle only. Hence for constructing a dc motor it is essential to establish a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a>. The <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> is obviously established by means of magnet. The magnet can by any types i.e. it may be electromagnet or it can be permanent magnet. When permanent magnet is used to create <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> in a <a href="../dc-motor-or-direct-current-motor/">DC motor</a>, the motor is referred as <strong>permanent magnet dc motor</strong> or <strong>PMDC motor</strong>. Have you ever uncovered any <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/">battery</a> operated toy, if you did, you had obviously found a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/" title="Battery">battery</a>  operated motor inside it. This  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/" title="Battery">battery</a>  operated motor is nothing but a <strong>permanent magnet dc motor</strong> or <strong>PMDC motor</strong>. These <a href="../electrical-motor-types-classification-and-history-of-motor/">types of motor</a> are essentially simple in construction. These motors are commonly used as starter motor in automobiles, windshield wipers, washer, for blowers used in heaters and air conditioners, to raise and lower windows, it also extensively used in toys. As the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> strength of a permanent magnet is fixed it cannot be controlled externally, field control of this type of dc motor cannot be possible. Thus permanent magnet dc motor is used where there is no need of speed control of motor by means of controlling its field. Small fractional and sub fractional kW motors now constructed with permanent magnet.<p></p>
<h2 id="Construction-of-Permanent-Magnet-DC-Motor-or-PMDC-Motor">Construction of Permanent Magnet DC Motor or PMDC Motor</h2>
<p></p><div id="attachment_8081" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 352px"><img src="../images/stator-of-permanent-magnet-.jpg" alt="Stator of Permanent Magnet DC Motor" width="342" height="342" class="size-full wp-image-8081"><p class="wp-caption-text">Stator of Permanent Magnet DC Motor</p></div><br>
As it is indicated in name of permanent magnet dc motor, the field poles of this motor are essentially made of permanent magnet. A PMDC motor mainly consists of two parts. A stator and an armature. Here the stator which is a steel cylinder. The magnets are mounted in the inner periphery of this cylinder. The permanent magnets are mounted in such a way that the N – pole and S – pole of each magnet are alternatively faced towards armature as shown in the figure below. That means, if N – pole of one magnet is faced towards armature then S – pole of very next magnet is faced towards armature.<p></p>
<p>In addition to holding the magnet on its inner periphery, the steel cylindrical stator also serves as low reluctance return path for the magnetic flux. Although field coil is not required in permanent magnet dc motor but still it is sometimes found that they are used along with permanent magnet. This is because if permanent magnets lose their strength, these lost magnetic strengths can be compensated by field excitation through these field coils. Generally, rare earth hard magnetic materials are used for these permanent magnet. </p>
<p>Rotor : The rotor of pmdc motor is similar to other <a href="../dc-motor-or-direct-current-motor/">DC motor</a>. The rotor or armature of permanent magnet dc motor also consists of core, windings and commutator. Armature core is made of number of varnish insulated, slotted circular lamination of steel sheets. By fixing these circular steel sheets one by one, a cylindrical shaped slotted armature core is formed. The varnish insulated laminated steel sheets are used to reduce <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  loss in armature of permanent magnet dc motor. These slots on the outer periphery of the armature core are used for housing armature conductors in them. The armature conductors are connected in a suitable manner which gives rise to armature winding. The end terminals of the winding are connected to the commutator segments placed on the motor shaft. Like other dc motor, carbon or graphite brushes are placed with spring pressure on the commutator segments to supply  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to the armature. </p>
<h2 id="Working-Principle-of-Permanent-Magnet-DC-Motor-or-PMDC-Motor">Working Principle of Permanent Magnet DC Motor or PMDC Motor</h2>
<p>As we said earlier the working principle of PMDC motor is just similar to the general <a href="../working-or-operating-principle-of-dc-motor/">working principle of DC motor</a>. That is when a carrying conductor comes inside a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a>, a mechanical force will be experienced by the conductor and the direction of this force is governed by <a href="../fleming-left-hand-rule-and-fleming-right-hand-rule/">Fleming’s left hand rule</a>. As in a permanent magnet dc motor, the armature is placed inside the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> of permanent magnet; the armature rotates in the direction of the generated force. Here each conductor of the armature experiences the mechanical force F = B.I.L Newton where B is the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a> strength in Tesla (weber / m<sup>2</sup>), I is the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in Ampere flowing through that conductor and L is length of the conductor in metre comes under the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"></a><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a>. Each conductor of the armature experiences a force and the compilation of those forces produces a torque, which tends to rotate the armature.</p>
<h3 id="Equivalent-Circuit-of-Permanent-Magnet-DC-Motor-or-PMDC-Motor">Equivalent Circuit of Permanent Magnet DC Motor or PMDC Motor</h3>
<p><img src="../images/equivalent-circuit-of-pmdc-.gif" alt="Equivalent circuit of a PMDC motor" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8083"><br>
As in PMDC motor the field is produced by permanent magnet, there is no need of drawing field coils in the equivalent circuit of permanent magnet dc motor. The supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/">voltage</a> to the armature will have armature <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> drop and rest of the supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is countered by back emf of the motor. Hence <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equation of the motor is given by,<br>
<img src="1.png' id="latexV%20%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B%20I%20R%5C%3B%2B%5C%3B%20E_b&amp;bg=DDDDDD&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" title="V \;=\; I R\;+\; E_b" style="vertical-align:1%" class="tex" alt="V \;=\; I R\;+\; E_b"><br>
Where I, is armature  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and R is armature <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the motor.<br>
E<sub>b</sub> is the back emf and V is the supply voltage.</p>
<h4 id="Advantages-of-Permanent-Magnet-DC-Motor-or-PMDC-Motor">Advantages of Permanent Magnet DC Motor or PMDC Motor</h4>
<p>PMDC motor have some advantages over other types of dc motors. They are :</p>
<ol>
<li>No need of field excitation arrangement.</li>
<li>No input power in consumed for excitation which improve efficiency of dc motor.</li>
<li>No field coil hence space for field coil is saved which reduces the overall size of the motor.</li>
<li>Cheaper and economical for fractional kW rated applications.</li>

<h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Permanent-Magnet-DC-Motor-or-PMDC-Motor">Disadvantages of Permanent Magnet DC Motor or PMDC Motor</h4>
<ol>
<li>In this case, the armature reaction of <a href="../dc-motor-or-direct-current-motor/">DC motor</a> cannot be compensated hence the magnetic strength of the field may get weak due to demagnetizing effect armature reaction.</li>
<li>There is also a chance of getting the poles permanently demagnetized (partial) due to excessive armature  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  during starting, reversal and overloading condition of the motor.</li>
<li>Another major disadvantage of PMDC motor is that, the field in the air gap is fixed and limited and it cannot be controlled externally. Therefore, very efficient speed control of DC motor in this type of motor is difficult. </li>

<h4 id="Applications-of-Permanent-Magnet-DC-Motor-or-PMDC-Motor">Applications of Permanent Magnet DC Motor or PMDC Motor</h4>
<p>PMDC motor is extensively used where small dc motors are required and also very effective control is not required, such as in automobiles starter, toys, wipers, washers, hot blowers, air conditioners, computer disc drives and in many more.</p>
