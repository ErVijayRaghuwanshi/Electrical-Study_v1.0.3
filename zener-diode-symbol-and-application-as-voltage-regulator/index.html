<p>Before entering the topic we should briefly know about the diodes, what is diode? It is basically made of semiconductors which have two characteristics p - type and n - type. The p - type and n - type semiconductors represent positive and negative type semi conductors. In p – type <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> number of holes is excess and in n - type number of electrons are greater than holes. When both of these types of characteristics are present in a single crystal then it can be termed as diode. The positive terminal of the,  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is connected with the p - side and the negative side is connected with the n-side. Now coming to <strong>zener diode</strong> it is nothing but a simple <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> connecting in reverse bias. It is mainly a special property of the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> rather than any special type of equipment. Clearance Zener invented this property of the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> that’s why it is named after him. The main principle of this special property is that there is a breakdown in the circuit if the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage</a> applied across a reversely biased it does not allow the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to flow across it. Now as the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is increased, the temperature increases and the crystal ions vibrate with greater amplitude and all these leads to the breakdown of the depletion layer(i.e, the layer at the junction of p - type and n - type). And when the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> exceeds an specific amount zener breakdown takes place.</p>
<h2 id="Zener-Diode-Circuit">Zener Diode Circuit</h2>
<p><strong>Zener Diode</strong> is nothing but a single <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> connected in a reverse bias, we have already stated that. A <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> connected in reverse bias positive in a circuit is shown below,<br />
<div id="attachment_4825" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 668px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/reverse-biased-diode1.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/reverse-biased-diode1.png" alt="diodezener diode" width="658" height="274" class="size-full wp-image-4825" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> connected in reverse bias</p></div><br />
The circuit symbol of Zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is also shown below. For convenience and understanding, it is used normally<br />
<div id="attachment_4827" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 668px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/symbol-of-zener-diode.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/symbol-of-zener-diode.png" alt="Symbol of Zener Diode" width="658" height="132" class="size-full wp-image-4827" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Symbol of Zener Diode</p></div></p>
</p>
<p>Now, discussing about the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> circuits we should look through the graphical representation of the operation of the zener diode</strong>. Normally it is called the V-I characteristics of a general p - n junction diode.</p>
<div id="attachment_4828" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 570px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/characteristics-of-p-n-diode.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/characteristics-of-p-n-diode.png" alt="characteristics of a p-n junction diode" width="560" height="466" class="size-full wp-image-4828" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Characteristics of a p-n junction diode</p></div>
<h3 id="Characteristics-of-a-Zener-Diode">Characteristics of a Zener Diode</h3>
<p>The above diagram shows the V-I characteristics of the zener diode. When the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is connected in forward bias, this <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> acts as a normal <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> but when the reverse bias <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is greater than a predetermined <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> zener breakdown <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> takes place. To make the breakdown <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> sharp and distinct, the doping is controlled and the surface imperfections are avoided. In the V-I characteristics above V<sub>z</sub> is the zener voltage, we can say. It is also the knee <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> because at this point the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is very rapid.</p>
<h3 id="Application-of-Zener-Diode">Application of Zener Diode</h3>
<p>As we have gone through the first part of the article we know what is zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> and what is the basic principle of operation of it. Now the question arises where this type of diodes are used. The main application of this type of diodes are as <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulator.</p>
<p>Over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> protector, as <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> reference. </p>
<p>We will discussed what is the application of zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> as <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulator, now we will discuss the other two points briefly.</p>
<p><b>Overvoltage protection</b> is done by using Zener diodes because there is  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing through the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> after the reverse bias <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> exceeds a certain value. This circuit provides safety for the equipment connected at the terminals. Normally the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  should not exceed normal valve but if due to any fault in the circuit the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  exceeds the maximum allowable limit, the equipment of the system can be damaged permanently. A <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> is used, by it the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is quickly cut down and a fuse blows which disconnects the input source power. The circuit arrangement is shown below for better understanding,<br />
<div id="attachment_4829" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 570px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zener-diode-application.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zener-diode-application.png" alt="zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode"><p class="wp-caption-text">diode</a> <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulator" width="560" height="466" class="size-full wp-image-4829" /></a> Zener Diode as Voltage Regulator</p></div><br />
Voltage references determine the constant supply of power,  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> or <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage</a> as the zener <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> works if the supply of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is constant. That’s why to avoid unstable performance, zener diodes are used where <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> reference is required like ohmmeters, ammeters and voltmeters.</p>
<h3 id="Zener-Diode-as-Voltage-Regulator">Zener Diode as Voltage Regulator</h3>
<p>The term regulator means which regulates or controls. Zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> can work as a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulator if it is introduced in a circuit. The output across the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> will be constant. It is driven by a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" >current source</a>. As we know if the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> exceeds a certain value it would draw excessive  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>   from the supply. The basic diagram of <strong>zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> as <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulator</strong> is given below,</p>
<div id="attachment_4830" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 446px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zener-diode-voltage-regulator.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zener-diode-voltage-regulator.png" alt="Basic zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode"><p class="wp-caption-text">diode</a> shunt <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> regulator" width="436" height="436" class="size-full wp-image-4830" /></a> Basic zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> shunt regulator</p></div>
<p>To limit the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the Zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> series resistance R is introduced whose value can be chosen from the following equation <br/><br />
Resistor value (ohms) = (V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>2</sub>) / (zener  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  + load current)<br/></p>
<p>The above diagram is of a shunt regulators because the regulating element is parallel to the load. The Zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> produce a stable reference <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the load which fulfills the criteria of regulator. </p>
