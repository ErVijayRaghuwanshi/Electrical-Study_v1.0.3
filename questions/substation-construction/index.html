			<p>The construction of an electric substation is a combined with civil engineering, mechanical engineering and obviously electrical engineering. The initial process is started with selection of proper location or land for planting the substation. Before the foundation, a details work plan is developed which an important part of pre construction. A team of foundation specialists and crews are involved, and the concrete construction begins. After that foundation of base, the other planting process is started such as installation of steel framework, specifically the steel poles, towers etc. After that an expert team visits the substation to ensure the compatibility of the substation, and other tests are performed to ensure the foundation safety (such as load test on concrete base, load test on tower).</p><center><!-- Putu-1 -->
</p>
<p>The main and most costly constructional part of a substation is the transformer. Typically they are manufactured and checked by the supplier and arrived into the desired location by transport. The transformer is kept upon a concrete base. Bus bar and other wirings are connected with the transformer, and the feeders are also connected. In the mean time, the insulators are also provided with every open live point. Safety assemblies like switchgear, LA, Current Transformers, Potential Transformers etc are installed at their respective positions. A network of control cables connects all those components along with the transformer, and taken to the control cabin for remote operation. Actually these control cables are very vital, and several controlling tasks are performed through the control panel, which is located near the field yard. </p>
<p>Station service batteries are kept in the control cabin and wires connects them with several safety essentials like the relay coil. A team of expert visits the substation for final checking and the transformer is charged initially from the incoming lines, feeders are activated and tested. Routine maintenances are required for the transformers and switchgears after a substation is founded and started. When constructing a power substation, there are several rules or standard norms which must have to follow. There are called substation design standard intranet and includes safety standards for substation signage, cabling, cables standards, metering, substation earthing, clearance in air, safety earthing.                    </p>
