			<p>Size and available area for substation foundation is always a factor of consideration. Providing the best quality power is the main challenge in the present scenario, because of the ever increasing demand of electricity. The level of voltages and operation directly increases the cost and size of substation, but the maintenance of very wide field yard is quite hard, and the availability of land for foundation of substation is also a big factor. These necessitates the innovation of package substation or compact substation. As the name suggests, this type of substations are designed specially and the equipments like transformers, circuit breakers, switches etc are made as compact as possible. As the size of equipments are lesser, so the overall area of the substation is reduced. In very simple words, these are the compressed substations and installation of this type of substation is quite economical where the space is the main factor of consideration. </p><center><!-- Putu-1 -->
</p>
<p>The performance of package substations are same, but the best performance is observed for LV and MV operations. After manufacturing, the package substations or compact substations are gone through several type tests, where several characteristics are observed to ensure the best safety. The insulation strength of transformer, stress load test on packaged ring main bus, internal arc fault testing etc are done in the factory. Generally the package of transformer, safety switches, fuses etc are compressed into a metallic cabin and metallic lock doors are also provided with it. All live parts and junctions are checked and suitable insulations are provided with them. This type of plants can be easily installed in very limited space such as 6 square meter. Dry type or oil cooled type transformers are used in package substations and gas insulated switchgears are used for high voltage switching purpose.</p>
<p> The feeder cables are taken from the front side of the system, and for better safety mechanical interlock is installed with the door, additionally capacitive voltage detection technique is used for the feeders. The LV and MV switchgears are mounted on the wall, which reduces the costly cabling and overhead lines. The unit of substation is very easy to operate, and simple logistics is used for troubleshooting purposes. Additionally controlling of entire operation and synchronization of all equipments are effectively done from a dedicated control panel. The fault sensing and tripping operation is sometime automatic, so the risk associated is reduced. Most importantly the capital cost and running cost both are reduced effectively when using package substations.         </p>
