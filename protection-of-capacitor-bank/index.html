A <a href="../shunt-capacitor-capacitor-bank/index.html">shunt capacitor</a>  is protected both from internally and externally where possible. Since fault may occur in the system as well as in the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> units themselves.</p>
<p>Normally all the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> units are provided with in-built <a href="../electrical-fuse-hrc-fuse-high-rupturing-capacity/index.html">electrical fuse</a> unit to protect each unit individually. During any internal fault in the unit, it should be automatically disconnected from the rest of the bank. When a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> shell is disconnected from the bank, due to fuse failure, there would not be any hamper of normal operation of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank. Only the capacity of the bank becomes little low.</p>
<p>When a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> unit or shell is disconnected the rest of the units in same group will face higher <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltage</a> stress. If any further failure of unit, occurs, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stress in remaining shells in the group again rises generally a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> unit has only 110% continuous <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> withstand capacity. Hence, over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stress of remaining <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> units, may came easy failure of remaining. That is why it is quite desired to have an automatic <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> unit failure indication so that, the damaged unit can easily be replaced by good one, for saving other unit from continuous over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stress. There are several <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> sensitive protection scheme of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank for this purpose.</p>

<p><img src="../images/protection-of-capacitor-bank.png" alt="protection of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank" width="426" height="426" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11689" /></p>
<p>Here in this scheme of <strong>capacitor bank protection</strong>, one <a href="../high-voltage-transformer/index.html" >potential transformer</a> is connected across <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> group of each phase. The secondary of these three <a href="../high-voltage-transformer/index.html">PTs</a> are connected in open delta and a over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and time delay relay is connected across the open delta terminals of PTs secondaries. As soon as <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> unbalance occurs between three <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> groups, resultant <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage</a> appears across the open delta terminals. If this resultant <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> crosses the preset value of the relay, the relay will actuate.</p>
<p><img src="../images/over-voltage-capacitor-bank-protection.png" alt="capacitor protection" width="384" height="384" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11691" /></p>
<p>In this scheme of <strong>capacitor bank protection</strong>, the star point of shunt <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank is earthed through a <a href="../high-voltage-transformer/index.html" >potential transformer</a>. One over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and time delay relay is connected across the secondary of the potential transformer. During balanced condition there would not be any potential difference appears across the PT coil but during unbalance condition, the potential at star point of the bank will no longer remain zero. Hence, there will be a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> appears across the PT and hence relay will actuate if this <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> crosses preset value of relay.<br />
<img src="../images/capacitor-protection.png" alt="capacitor protection " width="568" height="284" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11692" /></p>
<p>Here, <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> units of each phase is divided in two groups. These two groups of same phase are in parallel connected together. The shunt <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank is star connected. A <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a> is connected between common point of each star bank. During balanced condition, the potential of star point of both bank are same, hence there would not be any  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a>. But when unbalanced occur in any of the bank, the potential of two ends of the CT will no longer be zero and hence   <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  starts flowing through CT depending upon <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage difference</a> between two star points. If the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> crosses preset value of the relay connected to the CT secondary will actuate.<br />
<img src="../images/protection-of-capacito-bank.png" alt="capacitor bank protection" width="384" height="384" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11693" /></p>
<p>In this scheme of protection of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank, the star point of shunt <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> is solidly grounded through a neutral CT. A <a href="../over-current-relay-working-principle-types/index.html" >over  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  time delay relay</a> is connected with secondary of this neutral <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a> with secondary of this neutral  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer. During unbalancing,  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will flow through neutral <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >CT</a> and actuate the relay if the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  crosses the preset value.</p>
<p>These are not all scheme of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank protection, there may be other protection scheme also available, which do not cover in this page.</p>
