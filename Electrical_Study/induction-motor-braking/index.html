<p><a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" >Induction motors</a> are used at various places. Speed control of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" >induction motors</a> is quite difficult and that’s why their use was restricted and <a href="../dc-motor-or-direct-current-motor/index.html" >DC motors</a> had to be used as their speed regulation was possible. But when <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> drives were invented and implemented, they were given preference because of many advantages over <a href="../dc-motor-or-direct-current-motor/index.html" >DC motors</a>. Whenever controlling of motors is done, braking is the most important term, so as with induction motors. <strong> <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">Induction motor</a> braking </strong> can be done by different methods, which are <br/><br />
i.	<strong>Regenerative braking of induction motor</strong> <br/><br />
ii.	<strong>plugging Braking of induction motor</strong> <br/><br />
iii.	<strong>Dynamic braking of induction motor</strong> is further categorized as <br/><br />
a)	AC dynamic breaking <br/><br />
b)	Self excited braking using  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> <br/><br />

<h2 id="Regenerative_Braking_of_Induction_Motor">Regenerative Braking of Induction Motor</h2>
<p> We know the power (input) of an <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is given as. <br/><br />

<p>Here,  &phi;<sub>s</sub> the phase angle between stator phase <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V and the stator phase  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>s</sub>. Now, for motoring operation &phi;<sub>s</sub> &lt; 90&deg; and for braking operation &phi;<sub>s</sub> &gt; 90&deg;. When the speed of the motor is more than the synchronous speed, relative speed between the motor conductors and air gap rotating field reverses, as a result the phase angle because greater than 90&deg; and the power flow reverse and thus regenerative braking takes place. The nature of the speed torque curves are shown in the figure beside. It the source frequency is fixed then the <strong>regenerative braking of induction motor</strong> can only take place if the speed of the motor is greater than synchronous speed, but with a variable frequency source <strong>regenerative braking of induction motor</strong> can occur for speeds lower than synchronous speed. The main advantage of this kind of braking can be said that the generated power is use fully employed and the main disadvantage of this type of braking is that for fixed frequency sources, braking cannot happen below synchronous speeds. </p>

<h2 id="Plugging_Braking_of_Induction_Motor">Plugging Braking of Induction Motor</h2>
<p>Plugging <strong>induction motor braking</strong> is done by reversing the phase sequence of the motor. <strong>Plugging braking of induction motor</strong> is done by interchanging connections of any two phases of stator with respect of supply terminals. And with that the operation of motoring shifts to <strong>plugging braking</strong>. During plugging the slip is (2 - s), if the original slip of the running motor is s, then it can be shown in the following way.<br />

<div id="attachment_3531" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 710px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-braking.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-braking.gif" alt="induction motor braking" width="700" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-3531" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Induction Motor Braking</p></div></p>
<p>From the figure beside we can see that the torque is not zero at zero speed. That’s why when the motor is needed to be stopped, it should be disconnected from the supply at near zero speed. The motor is connected to rotate in the reverse direction and the torque is not zero at zero or any other speed, and as a result the motor first decelerates to zero and then smoothly accelerates in the opposite direction. <br/><br/></p>
<h2 id="Dynamic_Braking_of_Induction_Motor">Dynamic Braking of Induction Motor</h2>
<p>There are four type of <strong>dynamic braking of induction motor</strong> or <strong>rheostatic braking </strong>, we will discuss about then.<br />
 <b>AC Dynamic Braking </b> - This type of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> braking is obtained when the motor is made to run on a single phase supply by disconnecting any one of the three phase from the source, and it is either left open or it is connected with another phase. When the disconnected phase is left open, it is called two lead connection and when the disconnected phase is connected to another machine phase it is known as three load connection. The braking operation can be understood easily. When the motor is running on  1-phase supply, the motor is fed by positive and negative sequence, net torque produced by the machine at that point of time is sum of torques due to positive and negative sequence voltage. At high <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> the net torque is found to be negative and braking occurs. From the figure below the two and three load connections can be understood.<br />

<b>Self excited braking using  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a>   </b></p>
<div id="attachment_3535" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 710px"><a href="../induction-motor-braking/induction-motor-drive-2/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-3535"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-drive-2.gif" alt="Self excited braking of induction motor" width="700" height="314" class="size-full wp-image-3535" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Self excited braking of induction motor</p></div>
<p>The figures above shows the circuit diagram and various characteristics of self excited braking using capacitors. As we can see from the figure, in this method there  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> are kept permanently connected across the source terminals of the motor. The value of the  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> are chosen depending upon their capability to deliver enough reactive  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to excite the motor and make it work as a generator. So, that when the motor terminals are disconnected from the source the motor works as a self excited generator and the produced torque and field is in the opposite direction and the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> braking operation occurs. In the figure (b) the curve A represents the no load magnetization curve and line B is the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through capacitors, which is given by </p>
<p>Here E is the stator induced <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> per phase <br/><br />
The speed torque characteristics under self excited braking is shown in the figure (c). To increase the braking torque and to utilize the generated energy sometimes external <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> are connected across the stator terminals. </p>
<p><b> DC Dynamic braking </b> To obtain this type of braking the stator of a running <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is connected to a dc supply. Two and three load connections are the two common type of connections for star and delta connected stators.<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-braking-1.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-braking-1.gif" alt="induction-motor-braking-1" width="700" height="288" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3538" /></a></p>
<p>Another diagram is shown below to illustrate how by <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> bridge two load coonection can be obtained within a circuit.<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dynamic-braking-operation.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dynamic-braking-operation.gif" alt="dynamic braking operation" width="400" height="283" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3539" /></a><br />
<b>Two loads dc dynamic braking operation</b><br />
Now coming to the method of operation, the moment when AC supply is disconnected and DC supply is introduced across the terminals of the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" >induction motor</a>, there is a stationery <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> generated due to the DC  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow and as the rotor of the motor rotates in that field, there is a field induces in the rotor winding, and as a result the machine works as a generator and the generated energy dissipates in the rotor circuit <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> and dynamic braking of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> occurs. </p>
<p><b> Zero sequence braking </b> In this type of braking all the three stator phases are connected in series and single phase ac or dc is connected across them (as shown in the figure). This type of connection is called zero-sequence connection, because  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> in all the stator windings are co-phasal. When the connected supply is ac, resultant field is stationery in space and pulsates at the frequency of supply, when the supply is dc, resultant field is stationery and is of constant magnitude. The main advantage of this <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> braking is that all the stator phases are uniformly loaded. It does not require large rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> like ac dynamic braking, it does not require large rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. The circuit diagram and the speed torque characteristics are shown below.<br />

The above discussion easily describes the concept of <strong>induction motor breaking</strong>.</p>
