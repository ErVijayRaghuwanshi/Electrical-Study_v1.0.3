The insulating material ( may be fluid or air) used in <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a> should serve two important functions. They are written as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>It should provide sufficient insulation between the contacts when <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a> opens.</li>
<li>It should extinguish the arc occurring between the contacts when <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> opens.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second point needs more explanation. To understand this point let us consider a situation if there is some fault or short circuit in the system, the relay provides desired signals to the <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> so as to prevent system from ongoing fault. Now when <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" >circuit breaker</a> opens its contacts, due to this an arc is drawn. The arc is interrupted by suitable insulator and technique.</p>
<h3>Methods of Arc Interruption</h3>
<p>There are two methods by which interruption is done.                                                                     </p>
<ol>
<li>High <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> method, </li>
<li>Low <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> method or zero interruption method. </li>
</ol>
<p> In high interruption method we can increase the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> many times to such a high value that it forces the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to reach to zero and thus restricting the possibility of arc being restruck. Proper steps must be taken in order to ensure that the rate at which the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is increased or decreased is not abnormal because it may lead to generation of harmful induced <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltages</a> in the system. The arc <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> can be increased by various methods like lengthening or cooling of the arc etc.</p>
<p>Limitations of high <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> method: Arc discharge has a resistive nature due to this most of the energy is received by <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> itself hence proper care should be taken during the manufacturing of <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> like mechanical strength etc. Therefore this method is applied in dc power <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a>, low and medium ac power circuit breaker.</p>
</p>
<p> Low <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> method is applicable only for ac circuit and it is possible there because of presence of natural zero  of current. The arc gets extinguished at the natural zero of the ac wave and is prevented from restricting again by rapid building of dielectric strength of the contact space.</p>
<p>There are two theories which explains the phenomenon of arc extinction: </p>
<ol>
<li>Energy balance theory,</li>
<li>Voltage race theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before going in details about these theories, we should know the following terms.</p>
<li><b><span class="Green">Restriking voltage:</span></b> It may be defined as the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltage</a> that appears across the breaking contact at the instant of arc  extinction.</li>
<li><b><span class="Green">Recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> : </span></b>It may be defined as the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltage</a> that appears across the breaker contact after the complete removal of transient oscillations and final extinction of arc has resulted in all the poles.</li>
<li><b><span class="Green">Active recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> :</span></b> It may be defined as the instantaneous recovery <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> at the instant of arc extinction. </li>
<li><b><span class="Green"> Arc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> :</span></b> It may be defined as the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltage</a> that appears across the contact during the arcing period, when the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow is maintained in the form of an arc. It assumes low value except for the point at which the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rise rapidly to a peak value and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  reaches to zero.</li>
<ol>
<li><b><u>Energy Balance Theory:</u></b> When the contact of <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a> are about to open, restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is zero, hence generated heat would be zero and when the contacts are fully open there is infinite resistance this again make no production of heat. We can conclude from this that the maximum generated heat is lying                              between these two cases and can be approximated, now this theory is based on the fact that the rate of<br />
generation of heat between the the contacts of <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a> is lower than the rate at which heat                                                 between the contact is dissipated. Thus if it is possible to remove the generated heat by cooling, lengthening and splitting the arc at a high rate the generation, arc can be extinguished.</li>
<li><b><u>Voltage Race Theory :</u></b> The arc is due to the ionisation of the gap between the contact of the <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a>. Thus the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> at the initial stage is very small i.e. when the contact are closed and as the contact separates the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> starts increasing. If we remove ions at the initial stage either by recombining them into neutral molecules or inserting insulation at a rate faster than the rate of ionisation, the arc can be interrupted. The ionisation at zero  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  depends on the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> known as <b>restriking voltage</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us define an expression for restriking voltage. For loss-less or ideal system we have,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/ait-06-06-14-01.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Here v = restriking voltage.</p>
<p>  V = value of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> at the instant of interruption. </p>
<p>  L and C are series <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> and shunt <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitance</a>  up to fault point.</p>
<p>  Thus from above equation we can see that lower the value of product of L and C, higher the value of restriking voltage.</p>
<p>  The variation of v versus time is plotted below:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7523" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 392px"><a href="../arc-interruption-theory/arc-interruption-theory-1/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-7523"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/arc-interruption-theory-1.jpg" alt="Restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference"><p class="wp-caption-text">voltage</a> across breaker contacts " width="382" height="280" class="size-full wp-image-7523" /></a> Restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across breaker contacts</p></div><br />
Now let us consider a practical system, or assume there finite loss in the system. As fig. shown below in this case the restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is damped out due to the presence of some finite <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. Here it is assumed that the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  lags behind the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by an angle(measured in degrees) of 90.However in practical situation angle may varies depending upon time in cycle at which the fault is occurred.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7515" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 395px"><a href="../arc-interruption-theory/arc-interruption-theory-2-2/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-7515"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/arc-interruption-theory-2.jpg" alt="Restriking voltage" width="385" height="248" class="size-full wp-image-7515" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> when asymmetrical  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is itesrrssupted</p></div><br />
 Let us consider the effect of arc voltage, if arc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is included in the system, there is an increment in the   restriking voltage. However this is offset by another effect of an arc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> which opposes the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow and making change in the phase of current, thus bringing it more into phase with the applied voltage. Hence the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is not at its peak value when <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> passes through zero value.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7516" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 412px"><a href="../arc-interruption-theory/arc-interruption-theory-3/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-7516"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/arc-interruption-theory-3.jpg" alt="Restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference"><p class="wp-caption-text">voltage</a> including arc voltage" width="402" height="213" class="size-full wp-image-7516" /></a> Restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> including arc voltage</p></div><br />
<span class="Green"><u><b>Rate of Rise of Restriking Voltage (RRRV):</span></u></b> It is defined as the ratio of peak value of restriking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to time taken to reach to peak value. It is one of the most important parameter as if the rate at which the dielectric strength developed between the contacts is greater than RRRV, then the arc will be extinguishes.</p>
