<p>The application of transistors is very high in frequency range are hampered due to the transit time and other effects. Many devices use the negative <a href="../electrical-conductivity-of-metal-semiconductor-and-insulator/index.html" title="Electrical Conductance">conductance</a>      property of semiconductors for high frequency applications. <strong>Tunnel diode</strong> is one of the most commonly used negative <a href="../electrical-conductivity-of-metal-semiconductor-and-insulator/index.html" title="Electrical Conductance">conductance</a>      devices. It is also known as Esaki <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> after L. Esaki for his work on this effect.</p>
<p>This <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is a two terminal device. The concentration of dopants in both p and n region is very high. It is about 10<sup>24</sup> - 10<sup>25</sup> m<sup>-3</sup> the p-n junction is also abrupt. For this reasons, the depletion layer width is very small. In the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> characteristics of <strong>tunnel diode</strong>, we can find a negative slope region when forward bias is applied. Quantum mechanical tunneling is responsible for the phenomenon and thus this device is named as tunnel diode.</p>
<p>The doping is very high so at absolute zero temperature the Fermi levels lies within the bias of the semiconductors. When no bias is applied any  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through the junction.</p>
<h2 id="Characteristics-of-Tunnel-Diode">Characteristics of Tunnel Diode</h2>
<p>When reverse bias is applied the Fermi level of p - side becomes higher than the Fermi level of n-side. Hence, the tunneling of electrons from the balance band of p-side to the conduction band of n-side takes place. With the interments of the reverse bias the tunnel  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  also increases. When forward junction is a applied the Fermi level of n - side becomes higher that the Fermi level of p - side thus the tunneling of electrons from the n - side to p - side takes place. The amount of the tunnel  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is very large than the normal junction current. When the forward bias is increased, the tunnel  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is increased up to certain limit. When the band edge of n - side is same with the Fermi level in p - side the tunnel  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is maximum with the further increment in the forward bias the tunnel  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  decreases and we get the desired negative conduction region. When the forward bias is raised further, normal p-n junction  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is obtained which is exponentially proportional to the applied voltage. The V - I characteristics of the tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is given,<br />

<h2 id="Tunnel-Diode-Applications">Tunnel Diode Applications</h2>
<p>Tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is a type of sc <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> which is capable of very fast and in microwave frequency range. It was the quantum mechanical effect which is known as tunneling. It is ideal for fast oscillators and receivers for its negative slope characteristics. But it cannot be used in large integrated circuits – that’s why it’s an applications are limited. </p>
<p>When the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage</a> is first applied  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  stars flowing through it. The  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  increases with the increase of voltage. Once the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rises high enough suddenly the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  again starts increasing and tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> stars behaving like a normal diode. Because of this unusual behavior, it can be used in number of special applications started below.</p>
<p>Oscillator circuits :Tunnel diodes can be used as high frequency oscillators as the transition between the high electrical conductivity is very rapid. They can be used to create oscillation as high as 5Gz. Even they are capable of creativity oscillation up to 100 GHz in a appropriate digital circuits.</p>
<p>Used in microwave circuits: Normal <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> transistors do not perform well in microwave operation. So, for microwave generators and amplifiers tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> are. In microwave waves and satellite communication equipments they were used widely, but now a day’s their uses is decreasing rapidly as transistor for working in wave frequency area available in market.</p>
<p>Resistant to nuclear radiation :Tunnel diodes are resistant to the effects of <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>s, high temperature and radioactivity. That’s why these can be used in modern military equipment. These are used in nuclear magnetic resource machine also. But the most important field of its use satellite communication equipments.</p>
<h3 id="Tunnel-Diode-Oscillator">Tunnel Diode Oscillator</h3>
<p>Tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> can make a very stable oscillator circuit when they are coupled to a tuned circuit or cavity, biased at the centre point of negative <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> region. Here is an example of tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> oscillatory circuit.<br />
<div id="attachment_4995" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 674px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tunnel-diode-oscillator.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tunnel-diode-oscillator.png" alt="tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode"><p class="wp-caption-text">diode</a> oscillator " width="664" height="380" class="size-full wp-image-4995" /></a> Tunnel Diode Oscillator</p></div></p>
<p>The tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is losing coupled to a tunable cavity. By using a short, antenna feed probe placed in the cavity off centre loose coupling is achieved. To increase the stability of oscillation and achieve o/p power over wider bandwidth loose coupling is used. The range of the output power produced is few hundred micro-watts. This is useful for many microwave application. The physical position of the tuner determining the frequency of operation. If the frequency of operation is changed by this method, that is called mechanical tuning. Tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> oscillators can be tuned electronically also.</p>
<p>Tunnel <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> oscillators which are meant to be operated at microwave frequencies, generally used some form of transmission lines as tunnel circuit. These oscillators are useful in application that requires a few millwatts of power, example- local oscillators for microwave super electrodyne receiver.</p>
