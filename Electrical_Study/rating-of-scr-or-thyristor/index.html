<p><strong>Thyristor ratings</strong> or <strong>SCR ratings</strong> are very much required for operating it in a safe zone. The reliable operation can be done when a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> does not violate its <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and current rating during working period. A <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a>, or <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> may have several ratings, such as voltage, current, power, dv/dt, di/dt, turn on time, turn off time, etc. Generally these ratings are specified in the data sheet given by manufacturer.</p>
<h3 id="Anode-Voltage-Rating">Anode Voltage Rating</h3>
<p>This rating gives us a brief idea about withstanding power of a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> in forward blocking made in the absence of gate current.</p>
<h4>Peak Working Forward Blocking or Forward OFF State Voltage (V<sub>DWM</sub>)</h4>
<p>It specifies the maximum forward <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (positive <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> that applied across anode and cathode) that can be withstand by the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> at the time of working. </p>
</p>
<h4>Peak Repetitive Forward Blocking Voltage (V<sub>DRM</sub>)</h4>
<p>It specifies the peak forward transient <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> that a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> can block repeatedly or periodically in forward blocking mode. This rating is specified at a maximum allowable junction temperature with gate circuit open. During commutation process, due to high decreasing rate of reverse anode current a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> spike Ldi/dt is produced which is the cause of V<sub>DRM</sub> generation. </p>
<h4>Peak Non-Repetitive or Surge Forward Blocking Voltage (V<sub>DSM</sub>)</h4>
<p>It is the peak value of the forward transient <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> that does not appear periodically. This type of over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> generated at the time of switching operation of circuit breaker. This <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is 130 % of V<sub>DRM</sub>), although it lies under the forward break over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (V<sub>BD</sub>).</p>
<h4>Peak Working Revere Voltage (V<sub>RWM</sub>)</h4>
<p>It is the maximum reverse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (anode is negative with respect to cathode) which can be withstand by the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> repeatedly or periodically. It is nothing but peak negative value of the AC sinusoidal voltage.</p>
<h4>Peak Repetitive Revere Voltage (V<sub>RRM</sub>)</h4>
<p>It is the value of transient <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> that can be withstand by <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> in reverse bias at maximum allowable temperature. This reason behind the appearance of this <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is also same as V<sub>DRM</sub>.</p>
<h4>Peak Non Repetitive Revere Voltage (V<sub>RSM</sub>)</h4>
<p>It implies the reverse transient <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> that does not appear repetitively. Though this <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> value is 130% of V<sub>RRM</sub>, it lies under reverse break over voltage, V<sub>BR</sub>.<br />
Forward ON State <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> Drop (V<sub>T</sub>)</h4>
<p>This is the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across the anode and cathode when rated current flows through the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> at rated junction temperature. Generally this value is lie between 1 to 1.5 volts.</p>
<h3 id="Forward-dv/dt-Rating">Forward dv/dt Rating</h3>
<p>When we apply a forward <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> Junction J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>3</sub> are forward biased whereas junction J<sub>2</sub> is reverse biased and hence it acts a capacitor. So due to Cdv/dt a leakage current flows through the device. This value of current will increase with the value of dv/dt. One thing we have to keep in mind that <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> value is not the reason behind flowing of leakage current, the reason is the rate of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> increasing. The value of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitance</a>  of the junction is constant hence when dv/dt increases to a suitable value that leakage current occurs a avalanche breakdown across junction J<sub>2</sub>. This value of dv/dt in called forward dv/dt rating which can turn on the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> without help of gate current. In practice it is not suitable to apply high dv/dt due to high temperature malfunction of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a>.</p>
<h4>Voltage Safety Factor of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> (V<sub>SF</sub>)</h4>
<p>It is described as the ratio of peak repetitive reverse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (V<sub>RRM</sub>) to the maximum value of input voltage.<br />
<center><img src="../equations/power electronics/rscot-01-13-06-14.gif" alt=""></center></p>
<h4>Finger Voltage of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> (V<sub>FV</sub>)</h4>
<p>Minimum value of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> which must be applied between anode and cathode for turning off the device by gate triggering. Generally this <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> value is little mare than normal ON state <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop.</p>
<h3 id="Current-Rating-of-SCR">Current Rating of SCR</h3>
<p>We all know that a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a>, hence a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> is made of <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> which is very much thermal sensitive. Even due to short time over current, the temperature of the device may rise to such a high value that it may cross its maximum allowable limit. Hence there will be a high chance of permanent destruction of the device. For this reason, <strong>current rating of SCR</strong> is very essential part to protect the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a>.</p>
<h4>Maximum RMS Current Rating (I<sub>RMS</sub>)</h4>
<p>Generations of heat in the device present where resistive elements are present in the device. Resistive elements such as metallic joints are totally dependent upon rms current as power loss is I<sub>RMS</sub><sup>2</sup>R, which is converts to heat, hence cause of temperature rise of the device. Hence, I<sub>RMS</sub> rating of the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> must be a suitable value so that maximum heat capability of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> cannot exceed.</p>
<h4>Maximum Average Current Rating (I<sub>AV</sub>)</h4>
<p>It is the allowable average current that can be applied safely such that maximum junction temperature and rms current limit cannot be exceeded. Generally manufacturer of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a>, provides a characteristic diagram which shows I<sub>AV</sub> as a function of the case temperature I<sub>C</sub> with the current conduction angle &phi; as a parameter. This characteristic is known as "forward average current de-rating characteristic".</p>
<h4>Maximum Surge Current (I<sub>SM</sub>)</h4>
<p>If a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> operates under its repetitive <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and current ratings, its maximum allowable temperature is never exceeded. But a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> may fall into a abnormal operating condition due to fault in the circuit. To overcome this problem, a maximum allowable surge current rating is also specified by manufacturer. This rating specifies maximum non repetitive surge current, that the device can withstand. This rating is specified dependent upon the number of surge cycle. At the time of manufacturing at least three different surge current ratings for different durations are specified. For example,<br />
I<sub>SM</sub> = 3,000A for 1/2 cycle</p>
<p>I<sub>SM</sub> = 2,100A for 3 cycles</p>
<p>I<sub>SM</sub> = 1,800A for 5 cycles</p>
<p>A plot between I<sub>SM</sub> and cycle numbers are also provided for dealing with the various cycle surge current.</p>
<h3 id="I<sup>2</sup>R-Rating-of-SCR">I<sup>2</sup>R Rating of SCR</h3>
<p>This rating is provided to get an idea about over-voltage tackle power of a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a>. The rating in term of A<sup>2</sup>S is the measure of energy that can be handled by a <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> for a short while. An electrical fuse I<sup>2</sup>R rating must be less than that of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> to be used to protect it.</p>
<h3 id="di/dt-Rating-of-SCR">di/dt Rating of SCR</h3>
<p>While, <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> is getting turn on, conduction stays in a very small area nearer to the gate. This small area of conduction spreads throughout the whole area of the junctions. But if spreading velocity of the charge carriers will be smaller than the di/dt then local hot spot may arise nearer to the gate which may destroy the device. To overcome this problem a maximum rate of rise of current, di/dt is also specified during manufacturing of the devices.</p>
<h3 id="Latching-Current-of-Thyristor">Latching Current of Thyristor</h3>
<p>This is the rating of current below which the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> can't be turned on even the gate signal is applied. That means this much anode current must rise to turn on the device. The gate pulse must be continuous until anode current is greater or equal to latching current of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a> other wise the device will fail to be turned on.</p>
<h3 id="Holding-Current-of-Thyristor">Holding Current of Thyristor</h3>
<p>This is the rating of current below, which anode current must fall to turn off the device.</p>
<h2 id="Gate-Specification-of-SCR">Gate Specification of SCR</h2>
<h3 id="Gate-Current-to-Trigger-(I<sub>GT</sub>)">Gate Current to Trigger (I<sub>GT</sub>)</h3>
<p>This is the value of gate current below which device cannot be turned on. This value of current specified at a particular forward break down voltage. </p>
<h3 id="Gate-Triggering-Voltage-(V<sub>GT</sub>)">Gate Triggering Voltage (V<sub>GT</sub>)</h3>
<p>This is the value of minimum gate <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> that must be a acquired by the gate circuit. for proper turn on of the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a>. This <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> value is also specified at a particular forward breakdown <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> similar to I<sub>GT</sub>.</p>
<h4>Non Triggering Gate Voltage (V<sub>NG</sub>)</h4>
<p>This is the maximum value of gate circuit source <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> below which the device must be in off state. All unwanted noise signals must lie under this <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to avoid unwanted turn on of the device.</p>
<h4>Peak Reverse Gate Voltage (V<sub>GRM</sub>)</h4>
<p>This is the value of maximum reverse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> which can be applied across the cathode and gate. </p>
<h4>Average Gate Power Dissipation (P<sub>GAR</sub>)</h4>
<p>This is the value of average power dissipation which cannot be exceeded by a gate circuit for a gate current pulse wider than 100 microsecond.</p>
<h4>Peak Forwarded Gate Current (I<sub>GRM</sub>)</h4>
<p>This is the rating of maximum forward gate current that should not be exceeded to reliable and safe operation.</p>
