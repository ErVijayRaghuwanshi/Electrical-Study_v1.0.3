</div>
<p>There are several <strong>voltage sources</strong> as well as <strong>current sources</strong> encountered in our daily life.   <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">Batteries</a> , <a href="../principle-of-dc-generator/index.html">DC generator</a> or <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html">alternator</a> all are very common examples of <strong>voltage source</strong>. There are also some <strong>current sources</strong> encountered in our everyday life, such as photo electric cells, metadyne generator etc.</p>
<p>The sources can be categorized into two different types – independent source and dependent source.</p>
<h2 id="Independent-Voltage-Source">Independent Voltage Source</h2>
<p>Output of an independent source does not depend upon the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltage</a> or  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of any other part of the network. When terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of a <strong>voltage source</strong> is not affected by the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> or <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of any other part of the network, then the source is said to be an <strong>independent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> </strong>. This type of sources may be referred as constant source or time variant source. When terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of an independent source remains constant throughout its operation, it is referred as time–invariant or constant <strong>independent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> </strong>.</p>
<p>Again independent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  can be time–variant type, where the output terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the source changes with time. Here, the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the source does not vary with change of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of any other part of the network but it varies with time.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Independent-Current-Source">Independent Current Source</h2>
<p>Similarly, output  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of independent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  does not depend upon the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of any other part of the network. It is also categorized as independent time-invariant and time-variant <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> .</p>
<p>Symbolic representations of independent time-invariant and time-variant <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> s are shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_211" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 580px"><a href="../ideal-practical-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-211"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/independent-voltage-current-source.gif" alt="independent voltage current sources" width="570" height="238" class="size-full wp-image-211" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">independent voltage current sources</p></div>
<p>Now we will discuss about dependent <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or <strong>current source</strong>. Dependent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  is one that's output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is the function of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> of any other part of the circuit. Similarly, dependent <strong>current source</strong> is one that's output <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> is the function of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of any other parts of the circuit. The amplifier is an ideal example of dependent source where the output signal depends upon the signal given to the input circuit of the amplifier.</p>
<h2 id="Dependent-Voltage-Source-&#038;-Dependent-Current-Source">Dependent Voltage Source &#038; Dependent Current Source</h2>
<p>There are four possible dependent sources as are represented below,</p>
<p><strong>
<ol>
<li>Voltage dependent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> .</li>
<li>Current dependent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> .</li>
<li>Voltage dependent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> .</li>
<li>Current dependent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> .</li>
</ol>
<p></strong></p>
<p>Dependent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> s and dependent <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> sources can also be time variant or time invariant. That means, when the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> of a dependent source is varied with time, referred as time invariant dependent <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> or <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  and if not varied with time, it is referred as time variant.</p>
<h2 id="Ideal-Voltage-Source">Ideal Voltage Source</h2>
<p>Now we will discuss about <strong>ideal <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> </strong>.</p>
<p>In every practical <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> , there is some <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> inside it. This <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is called internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the source. When the terminal of the source is open circuited, there is no <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> flowing through it; hence there is no <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop inside the source but when load is connected with the source, <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> starts flowing through the load as well as the source itself. Due to the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> inside the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> , there will be some <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across the source. Now if any one measures the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the source, he or she will get the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> between its terminals which is reduced by the amount of internal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop of the source. So there will be always a difference between no-load (when source terminals are open) and load voltages of a practical <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> . But in <strong>ideal <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> </strong> this difference is considered as zero that means there would not be any <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop in it when <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> flows through it and this implies that the internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of an ideal source must be zero. This can be concluded that, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the source remains constant for all values of load current.</p>
<p>The V-I characteristics of an ideal <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  is shown below.<br />
<div id="attachment_212" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 580px"><a href="../ideal-practical-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/v-i-characteristics-ideal-voltage-source/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-212"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/v-i-characteristics-ideal-voltage-source.gif" alt="VI Characteristics of Ideal Voltage Source" width="570" height="238" class="size-full wp-image-212" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">VI Characteristics of Ideal Voltage Source</p></div><br />
There is no as such example of ideal <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  but a <a href="../working-of-lead-acid-battery-lead-acid-secondary-storage-battery/index.html"> <a href="../working-of-lead-acid-battery-lead-acid-secondary-storage-battery/index.html" title="Working of Lead Acid Battery">lead acid  battery</a>   </a> or a dry cell can be considered an example when the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  drawn is below a certain limit.</p>
<h2 id="Ideal-Current-Source">Ideal Current Source</h2>
<p><strong>Ideal <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> s</strong> are those sources that supply constant  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to the load irrespective of their impedance. That means, whatever may be the load impedance; ideal <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  always gives same  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through it. Even if the load has infinite impedance or load, is open circuited to the <strong>ideal <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> </strong> that gives the same  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through it. So naturally from definition, it is clear that this type of <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  is not practically possible.</p>
<h2 id="Current-Source-to-Voltage-Source-Conversion">Current Source to Voltage Source Conversion</h2>
<p>All sources of electrical energy give both  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  as well as voltage. This is not practically possible to distinguish between <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  and <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> .  Any electrical source can be represented as <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  as well as <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> . It merely depends upon the operating condition. If the load impedance is much higher than internal impedance of the source, then it is preferable to consider the source as a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  on the other hand if the load impedance is much lower than internal impedance of the source; it is preferable to consider the source as a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> . Current source to <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  conversion or <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  to <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  conversion is always possible.</p>
<p>Now we will discuss how to convert a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  into <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Let us consider a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  which has no load terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or source <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V and internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> r. Now we have to convert this to an equivalent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> . For that, first we have to calculate the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  which might be flowing through the source if the terminal A and B of the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  were short circuited. That would be nothing but I = V / r. This  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will be supplied by the equivalent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  and that source will have the same <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> connected across it.<br />
<div id="attachment_213" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 580px"><a href="../ideal-practical-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/voltage-to-current-source-conversion/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-213"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/voltage-to-current-source-conversion.gif" alt="Voltage to Current source conversion" width="570" height="238" class="size-full wp-image-213" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Voltage to Current source conversion</p></div><br />
Similarly a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  of output  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I in parallel with <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> r can be converted into an equivalent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V = Ir and <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> r connected in series with it. </p>
