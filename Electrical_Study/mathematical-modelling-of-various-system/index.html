<h2 id="mathematical-modelling-of-various-system">Mathematical Modelling of Control System</h2>
<p>There are various types of physical systems namely we have </p>
<ol>
<li>Mechanical system.</li>
<li>Electrical system.</li>
<li>Electronic system.</li>
<li>Thermal system.</li>
<li>Hydraulic system.</li>
<li>Chemical system etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I describe these systems in detail let us know, what is the meaning of modeling of the system? <strong>Mathematical modelling of control system</strong> is the process of drawing the block diagram for these types of systems in order to determine the performance and the transfer functions. Now let us describe mechanical and electrical type of systems in detail. We will derive analogies between mechanical and electrical system only which are most important in understanding the theory of control system.</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-modelling-of-mechanical-systems">Mathematical Modelling of Mechanical Systems</h3>
<p>We have two types of mechanical systems. Mechanical system may be a linear mechanical system or it may be a rotational mechanical type of system.<br />
<span class="Green">In linear mechanical type of systems</span> we have three variables -</p>
<ol>
<li>Force which is represented by ‘F’.</li>
<li>Velocity which is represented by ‘V’.</li>
<li> Linear displacement represented by ‘X’</li>
</ol>
<p>And also we have three parameters-</p>
<ol>
<li>Mass which is represented by ‘M’.</li>
<li>Coefficient of viscous friction which is represented by ‘B’.</li>
<li>Spring constant which is represented by ‘K’.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Green">In rotational mechanical type of systems</span> we have three variables-</p>
<ol>
<li>Torque which is represented by ‘T’.</li>
<li>Angular velocity which is represented by ‘&omega;’</li>
<li>Angular displacement represented by ‘&theta;’</li>
</ol>
<p>And also we have two  parameters -</p>
<ol>
<li> Moment of inertia which is represented by ‘J’.</li>
<li>Coefficient of viscous friction which is represented by ‘B’.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let us consider the linear displacement mechanical system which is shown below-<br />
<div id="attachment_15441" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 476px"><img src="../images/mm-09-06-14-01.gif" alt="spring mass mechanical system" width="466" height="187" class="size-full wp-image-15441" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mechanical System</p></div><br />
We have already marked various variables in the diagram itself. We have x is the displacement as shown in the diagram. From the Newton’s second law of motion, we can write force as-<br />
<center><img src="../equations/mmovs-08-06-14-01.gif" alt=""></center><br />
From the diagram we can see that the,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/mmovs-08-06-14-02.gif" alt=""></center><br />
On substituting the values of F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub> in the above equation and taking the Laplace transform we have the transfer function as,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/mmovs-08-06-14-03.gif" alt=""></center><br />
This equation is <strong>mathematical modelling of mechanical control system</strong>.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-modelling-of-electrical-system">Mathematical Modelling of Electrical System</h3>
<p><span class="Green">In electrical type of systems</span> we have three variables -</p>
<ol>
<li>Voltage which is represented by ‘V’.</li>
<li> Current which is represented by ‘I’.</li>
<li>Charge which is represented by ‘Q’.</li>
</ol>
<p> And also we have three parameters which are active and passive elements -</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Resistance in detail.">Resistance</a> which is represented by ‘R’.</li>
<li>Capacitance which is represented by ‘C’.</li>
<li>Inductance which is represented by ‘L’.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we are in condition to derive analogy between electrical and mechanical types of systems. There are two types of analogies and they are written below:</p>
<p><span class="Green">Force Voltage Analogy :</span>  In order to understand this type of analogy, let us consider a circuit which consists of series combination of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> and capacitor.<br />
<div id="attachment_15443" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 419px"><img src="../images/mm-09-06-14-02.gif" alt="series rlc circuit" width="409" height="263" class="size-full wp-image-15443" /><p class="wp-caption-text">RLC Series Circuit</p></div><br />
A <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V is connected in series with these elements as shown in the circuit diagram. Now from the circuit diagram and with the help of KVL equation we write the expression for <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in terms of charge, <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> and <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> as,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/mmovs-08-06-14-04.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now comparing the above with that we have derived for the mechanical system we find that-</p>
<ol>
<li>Mass (M) is analogous to <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductance</a> (L).</li>
<li>Force is analogous to <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V.</li>
<li>Displacement (x) is analogous to charge (Q).</li>
<li>Coefficient of friction (B) is analogous to <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R and</li>
<li>Spring constant is analogous to inverse of the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> (C).</li>
</ol>
<p>This analogy is known as force <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> analogy.</p>
<p><b><u>Force Current Analogy</u> :</b> In order to understand this type of analogy, let us consider a circuit which consists of parallel combination of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>, <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> and capacitor.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_15442" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 507px"><img src="../images/mm-09-06-14-03.gif" alt="parallel rlc circuit" width="497" height="267" class="size-full wp-image-15442" /><p class="wp-caption-text">RLC Parallel Circuit</p></div><br />
A <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> E is connected in parallel with these elements as shown in the circuit diagram. Now from the circuit diagram and with the help of KCL equation we write the expression for current in terms of flux, <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> and <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> as,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/mmovs-08-06-14-05.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now comparing the above with that we have derived for the mechanical system we find that,</p>
<ol>
<li>Mass (M) is analogous to Capacitor (C).</li>
<li>Force is analogous to current I.</li>
<li>Displacement (x) is analogous to flux (&psi;).</li>
<li>Coefficient of friction (B) is analogous to <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Resistance in detail.">resistance</a> 1/ R and</li>
<li>Spring constant K is analogous to inverse of the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> (L).</li>
</ol>
<p>This analogy is known as force current analogy.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the rotational mechanical type of system which is shown below we have already marked various variables in the diagram itself. We have θ is the angular displacement as shown in the diagram. From the mechanical system, we can write equation for torque (which is analogous to force) as torque as,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/mmovs-08-06-14-06.gif" alt=""></center><br />
From the diagram we can see that the,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/mmovs-08-06-14-07.gif" alt=""></center><br />
On substituting the values of T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> in the above equation and taking the Laplace transform we have the transfer function as,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/mmovs-08-06-14-08.gif" alt=""></center><br />
This equation is mathematical modelling of electrical control system.</p>
