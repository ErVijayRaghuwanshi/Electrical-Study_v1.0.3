<p>Control engineering deals entirely with the study of control systems. A control system is a combination of elements arranged in a planned manner where each element causes and effect to produce a desired output. This cause and effect relationship is governed by a mathematical relation. When we give an input we get an output in a control system. The mathematical relation mentioned here if linear then the control system is termed as linear control system. For a linear system the cause is independent variable /input and the effect is dependent variable or output. The input-output are proportionally related and principle of superposition is applicable throughout the operating range of a system.In a control system the cause acts through a control process which in turn results into an effect. There may be variety of systems based on principle mentioned but all the systems have many common features and as such common approach for the study and analysis of control system is possible. Control system are used in many applications for example systems for the control of position , velocity, acceleration, temperature, pressure ,voltage and current. Automatic control system was introduced thousands of years ago. There are two types of control system theory that is modern and classical. Control engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with dynamic systems. It deals with modelling of dynamic systems and also designing of controllers.</p>
<p>Control action can be more easily understood with the help of an example. Lets discuss an example.</p>
<p>We know that control of room temperature is achieved by switching ON and switching OFF of a power supply to a heating appliance. Thus power supply to an appliance is switched ON , when the room temperature is felt low and switched OFF, when the desired temperature is reached. The above system can be modified, if the duration of application of power is predetermined to achieve the room temperature within desired limits. However, a further refinement can be made by measuring the difference between the actual room temperature and desired room temp. and this difference being the error is used to control the element which in turn controls the output i.e  room temperature.</p>
<p>The above description indicates that in the former case the output (room temperature) has no control on the input and the control action is purely based on a sort of predetermined calibration only, where as in the latter case the control action is affected by a feedback received from output to input.</p>
<p>Control engineering deals with two kinds of control system - open loop and closed loop control system. In recent years , control systems have assumed an increasingly important role in the development and advancement of modern civilization and technology. Practically every aspect of our day -to-day activities is affected by some types of control system. Control engineering thus have taken a strong place in our daily life. Microcontrollers, electrical circuits and digital signal processors all can be used in implementation of control system. Control engineering have widespread applications in diverse areas. It is used in defense sector , propulsion of rockets or aircraft and also in airlines. Control engineers design control system based on feedback loop as well in absence of feedback loop. Washing machine is an classic example of open loop control system. Control engineering has now emerged as an important discipline in the study of engineering. This is taught as a subject in most engineering disciplines like electrical , electronics engineering also in mechanical as well as in computer science engineering courses.</p>
