<h2 id="turn-on-time-of-SCR">Turn ON Time of SCR</h2>
<p>A forward biased <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">thyristor</a> can be turned on by applying a positive <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> between gate and cathode terminal. But it takes some transition time to go from forward blocking mode to forward conduction mode. This transition time is called <strong>turn on time of SCR</strong> and it can be subdivided into three small intervals as delay time (t<sub>d</sub>) rise time(t<sub>r</sub>), spread time(t<sub>s</sub>).</p>
<h3 id="delay-time">Delay Time of SCR</h3>
<p>After application of gate current, the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">thyristor</a> will start conducting over a very tiny region. <strong>Delay time of SCR</strong> can be defined as the time taken by the gate current to increase from 90% to 100% of its final value I<sub>g</sub>. From another point of view, <strong>delay time</strong> is the interval in which anode current rises from forward leakage current to 10% of its final value and at the same time anode <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> will fall from 100% to 90% of its initial value V<sub>a</sub>.</p>
<h3 id="rise-time">Rise Time of SCR</h3>
<p><strong>Rise time of SCR</strong> in the time taken by the anode current to rise from 10% to 90% of its final value. At the same time anode <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> will fall from 90% to 10% of its initial value V<sub>a</sub>. The phenomenon of decreasing anode <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and increasing anode current is entirely dependent upon the type of the load. For example if we connect a inductive load, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> will fall in a faster rate than the current increasing. This is happened because induction does not allow initially high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> change through it. On the other hand if we connect a capacitive load it does not allow initial high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> change through it, hence current increasing rate will be faster than the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> falling rate.</p>
</p>
<p>High increasing rate of di<sub>a</sub>/dt can create local hot spot in the device which is not suitable for proper operation. So, it is advisable to use a <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> in series with the device to tackle high di<sub>a</sub>/dt. Usually value of maximum allowable di/dt is in the range of 20 to 200 A per microsecond.</p>
<h3 id="spread-time">Spread Time of SCR</h3>
<p>It is the time taken by the anode current to rise from 90% to 100% of its final value. At the same time the anode <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> decreases from 10% of its initial value to smallest possible value. In this interval of time conduction spreads all over the area of cathode and the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> will go to fully ON State. <strong>Spread time of SCR</strong> depends upon the cross-sectional area of cathode.<br />
<div id="attachment_15985" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 513px"><img src="../images/thyristor.gif" alt="thyristor <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference"><p class="wp-caption-text">voltage</a> &amp; current waveforms during   turn-on and turn-off " width="503" height="392" class="size-full wp-image-15985" /> Thyristor Voltage &#038; Current Waveforms during   Turn-ON and Turn-OFF</p></div></p>
<h2 id="turn-off-time-of-SCR">Turn OFF Time of SCR</h2>
<p>Once the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">thyristor</a> is switched on or in other point of view, the anode current is above latching current, the gate losses control over it. That means gate circuit cannot turn off the device. For turning off the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> anode current must fall below the holding current. After anode current fall to zero we cannot apply forward <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the device due to presence of carrier charges into the four layers. So we must sweep out or recombine these charges to proper <strong>turn off of SCR</strong>. So <strong>turn off time of SCR</strong> can be defined as the interval between anode current falls to zero and device regains its forward blocking mode. On the basis of removing carrier charges from the four layers, <strong>turn off time of SCR</strong> can be divided into two time regions, </p>
<ol>
<li>Reverse Recovery Time.</li>
<li>Gate Recovery Time</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="reverse-recovery-time">Reverse Recovery Time</h3>
<p>It is the interval in which change carriers remove from J<sub>1</sub>, and J<sub>3</sub> junction. At time t<sub>1</sub>, anode current falls to zero and it will continue to increase in reverse direction with same slope (di/dt) of the forward decreasing current. This negative current will help to sweep out the carrier charges from junction J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>3</sub>. At the time t<sub>2</sub> carrier charge density is not sufficient to maintain the reverse current hence after t<sub>2</sub> this negative current will start to decrease. The value of current at t<sub>2</sub> is called reverse recovery current. Due to rapid decreasing of anode current, a reverse spike of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> may appear across the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a>. Total recovery time t<sub>3</sub> - t<sub>1</sub> is called <strong>reverse recovery time</strong>. After that, device will start to follow the applied reverse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and it gains the property to block the forward voltage.</p>
<h3 id="gate-recovery-time">Gate Recovery Time</h3>
<p>After sweeping out the carrier charges from junction J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>3</sub> during <strong>reverse recovery time</strong>, there still remain trapped charges in J<sub>2</sub> junction which prevent the <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/#What-is-Thyristor-or-SCR?" title="What is Thyristor or SCR?">SCR</a> from blocking the forward voltage. These trapped charge can be removed by recombination only and the interval in which this recombination is done, called <strong>gate recovery time</strong>.</p>
