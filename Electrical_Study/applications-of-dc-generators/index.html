<p>There are various types of <a href="../principle-of-dc-generator/index.html" title="DC Generator">DC generators</a> available for several types of services. The <strong>applications of these dc generators</strong> based on their characteristic are discussed below:</p>
<h2 id="Applications-of-Separately-Excited-DC-Generators">Applications of Separately Excited DC Generators</h2>
<p>These types of <a href="../principle-of-dc-generator/index.html" title="DC Generator">DC generators</a> are generally more expensive than <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Separately_Excited_DC_Generator"  >self-excited DC generators</a> because of their requirement of separate excitation source. Because of that their applications are restricted. They are generally used where the use of self-excited generators are unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>I.	Because of their ability of giving wide range of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> output, they are generally used for testing purpose in the laboratories.</p>
<p>II.	Separately excited generators operate in a stable condition with any variation in field excitation. Because of this property they are used as supply source of DC motors, whose speeds are to be controlled for various applications. Example- Ward Leonard Systems of speed control.</p>
<h2 id="Applications-of-Shunt-Wound-DC-Generators">Applications of Shunt Wound DC Generators</h2>
<p>The application of shunt generators are very much restricted for its dropping <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> characteristic. They are used to supply power to the apparatus situated very close to its position. These type of <a href="../principle-of-dc-generator/index.html" title="DC Generator">DC generators</a> generally give constant terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> for small distance operation with the help of field regulators from no load to full load.</p>
<p>I.	They are used for general lighting.</p>
<p>II.	They are used to charge  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  because they can be made to give constant output voltage.</p>
<p>III.	They are used for giving the excitation to the alternators.</p>
<p>IV.	They are also used for small power supply.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Applications-of-Series-Wound-DC-Generators">Applications of Series Wound DC Generators</h2>
<p>These types of generators are restricted for the use of power supply because of their increasing terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> characteristic with the increase in load current  from no load to full load. We can clearly see this characteristic from the characteristic curve of <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Series_Wound_Generator"  >series wound generator</a>. They give constant  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the dropping portion of the characteristic curve. For this property they can be used as constant <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  and employed for various applications.</p>
<p>I.	They are used for supplying field excitation  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in DC locomotives for regenerative breaking.</p>
<p>II.	This types of generators are used as boosters to compensate the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop in the feeder in various types of distribution systems such as railway service.</p>
<p>III.	In series arc lightening this type of generators are mainly used.</p>
<h2 id="Applications-of-Compound-Wound-DC-Generators">Applications of Compound Wound DC Generators</h2>
<p>Among various <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/index.html"  >types of DC generators</a>, the <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Compound_Wound_DC_Generator"  >compound wound DC generators</a> are most widely used because of its compensating property. We can get desired terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> by compensating the drop due to armature reaction and ohmic drop in the in the line. Such generators have various applications.</p>
<p>I.	Cumulative compound wound generators are generally used lighting, power supply purpose and for heavy power services because of their constant <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> property. They are mainly made over compounded.</p>
<p>II.	Cumulative compound wound generators are also used for driving a motor.</p>
<p>III.	For small distance operation, such as power supply for hotels, offices, homes and lodges, the flat compounded generators are generally used.</p>
<p>IV.	The differential compound wound generators, because of their large demagnetization armature reaction, are used for arc welding where huge <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop and constant  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is required.</p>
<p>At present time the <strong>applications of DC generators</strong> become very limited because of technical and economic reasons. Now a days the <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Electric Power">electric power</a> is mainly generated in the form of alternating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  with the help of various power electronics devices.</p>
