<h2 id="Design-of-Foundation-of-Transmission-Towers-in-Different-Soils">Design of Foundation of Transmission Towers in Different Soils</h2>
<p>1. All foundation shall be of RCC. The design and construction of RCC structures shall be carried out as per IS:456 and minimum grade of concrete shall be M-20.</p>
<p>2. Limit state method of design shall be adopted.</p>
<p>3. Cold twisted deformed bars as per IS:1786 or TMT bars shall be used as reinforcement.</p>
<p>4. Foundations shall be designed for the critical loading combination of the steel structure and or equipment and/or superstructure.</p>
<p>5. If required protection to the foundation, shall be provided to take care of any special requirements for aggressive alkaline soil, black cotton soil or any soil which is detrimental/harmful to the concrete foundations.</p>
<p>6. All structures shall be checked for sliding and overturning stability during both construction and operating conditions for various combination of loads.</p>
<p>7. For checking against overturning, weight of soil vertically above footing shall be taken and inverted frustum of pyramid of earth on foundation should not be considered.</p>
<p>8. Base slab of any underground enclosure shall also be designed for maximum ground water table. Minimum factor of safety of 1.5 against bouncy shall be ensured.</p>
<p>9.The tower and equipment foundations shall be checked for a factor of safety of 2.2 for normal condition and 1.65 for short circuit condition against sliding, overturning and pullout.</p>

<p>The transmission tower may be situated in different locations. Power System transmission networks are being sprading all over the world. The soil condition of different places are also different. Depending upon the nature of soil, the types foundation of transmission towers should be selected and constructed accordingly. We have tried to give you a clear and brief Guidelines for classification of Foundations of transmission towers in different Soil conditions.</p>
