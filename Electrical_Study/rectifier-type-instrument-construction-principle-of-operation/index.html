<p><strong>Rectifier type instrument</strong> measures the alternating <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  with the help of rectifying elements and <a href="../permanent-magnet-moving-coil-instrument/index.html"  >permanent magnet moving coil type of instruments</a>. However the primary function of rectifier type of instruments work as voltmeter. Now one question must arises in our mind why we use rectifier type of instruments widely in the industrial world though we have various other ac voltmeter like electrodynamometer type instruments, <a href="../thermocouple-type-instruments-construction-principle-of-operation/index.html"  >thermocouple type instruments</a> etc? The answer to this question is very simple and is written as follows.</p>
<p>(a) Cost of electrodynamometer type of instruments is quite high than rectifier type of instruments. However rectifier type of instruments as much accurate as electrodynamometer type of instruments. So rectifier type of instruments are preferred over electrodynamometer type instruments.</p>
<p>(b) The <a href="../thermocouple-type-instruments-construction-principle-of-operation/index.html"  >thermocouple instruments</a> are more delicate than the rectifier type of instruments. However thermocouple type of instruments is more widely used at very high frequencies.</p>
<p>Before we look at the construction principle and <strong>working of rectifier type instruments</strong>, there is need to discuss in detail about the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a>  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  characteristics of ideal and practical rectifier element called <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html"  >diode</a>. </p>
<p>Let us first discuss the ideal characteristics of rectifying element. Now what is an ideal rectifying element? A rectifying element is one which offers zero <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> if it is forward biased and offers infinite <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> if it is reversed biased. This property is used to rectify the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltages</a> (rectification means to convert an alternating quantity into direct quantity i.e. ac to dc). Consider the circuit diagram given below.<br />
<img src="../images/diode-rectifier-25.11.13.gif" alt="halh wave <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> rectifier" width="329" height="233" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8746" /><br />
In the given circuit diagram the ideal <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html"  >diode</a> is connected in series with the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html"  >voltage source</a> and load <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. Now when we make the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> forward biased it conducts perfectly offering zero electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> path. Thus behaves as short circuited. We can make the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> forward biased by connecting the positive terminal of the <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html"  >battery</a> with anode and negative terminal with cathode. The forward characteristic of rectifying element or <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html"  >diode</a> is shown in the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a>  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> characteristic. Now when we apply negative <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> i.e. connecting the negative terminal of the <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html"  >battery</a> with the anode terminal of the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html"  >diode</a> and positive terminal of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  to the cathode terminal of the diode. Due to reverse biased it offers infinite electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> and thus it behaves as open circuit. The complete <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a>  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  characteristics are shown below.<br />
<div id="attachment_8750" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 312px"><img src="../images/ideal-diode-characteristics-25.11.13.gif" alt="ideal <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode"><p class="wp-caption-text">diode</a> characteristics" width="302" height="303" class="size-full wp-image-8750" /> Ideal Diode Characteristics</p></div><br />
Let us again consider the same circuit but the difference is here we are using the practical rectifying element instead of ideal one. Practical rectifying element is having some finite forward blocking <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and high reverse blocking voltage. We will apply the same procedure in order to obtain the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a>  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> characteristics of practical rectifying element. Now when we make the practical rectifying element forward biased it does not conduct till the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is not greater the forward breakdown <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> or we can say knee voltage. When the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> becomes greater than the knee <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> then <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html"  >diode</a> or rectifying element will come under conduction mode. Thus behaves as short circuited but due to some electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> there is <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across this practical diode. We can make the rectifying element forward biased by connecting the positive terminal of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  with anode and negative terminal with cathode. The forward characteristic of practical rectifying element or <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> is shown in the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a>  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  characteristic. Now when we apply negative <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> i.e. connecting the negative terminal of the <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html"  >battery</a> with the anode terminal of the <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> and positive terminal of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  to the cathode terminal of the rectifying element. Due to reverse biased it offers finite <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> and the negative <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> till the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> becomes equal to reverse break down <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and thus it behaves as open circuit. The complete characteristics are shown below<br />

Now rectifier type of instruments uses two types of rectifier circuits:</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Half-Wave-Rectifier-Circuits-of-Rectifier-Type-Instruments">Half Wave Rectifier Circuits of Rectifier Type Instruments</h2>
<p> Let us consider a circuit given below in which the rectifying element is connected in series with sinusoidal <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html"  >voltage source</a>, <a href="../permanent-magnet-moving-coil-instrument/index.html"  >permanent magnet moving coil instrument</a> and the multiplier <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/half-wave-rectifier-25.11.13.gif" alt="Half wave rectifier " width="478" height="269" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8755" /><br />
The function of this multiplier <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html"  >electrical resistance</a> is to limit the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> drawn by the <a href="../permanent-magnet-moving-coil-instrument/index.html"  >permanent magnet moving coil type of instrument</a>. It is very essential to limit the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  drawn by the <a href="../permanent-magnet-moving-coil-instrument/index.html"  >permanent magnet moving coil instrument</a> because if the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  exceeds the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  rating of <a href="../permanent-magnet-moving-coil-instrument/index.html"  >PMMC</a> then it destructs the instrument. Now here we divide our operation in two parts. In first part we apply constant dc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the above circuit. In the circuit diagram we are assuming the rectifying element as ideal one. Let us mark the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of multiplier be R, and that of <a href="../permanent-magnet-moving-coil-instrument/index.html"  >permanent magnet moving coil instrument</a> be R<sub>1</sub>.The dc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> produces a full scale deflection of magnitude I=V/(R+R1) where V is root mean square value of voltage. Now let us consider second case, in this case we will apply ac sinusoidal ac <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the circuit v=Vm*sin(wt) and we will get the output waveform as shown. In the positive half cycle the rectifying element will conduct and in the negative half cycle it does not conduct. So we will get a pulse of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> at moving coil instrument which produces pulsating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  thus pulsating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will produce pulsating torque. The deflection produced will corresponds to the average value of voltage. So let us calculate the average value of electric current, in order to calculate the average value of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> we have integrate the instantaneous expression of the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> from 0 to 2 pi. So the calculated average value of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a> comes out to be 0.45V.Again we have V is root mean square value of current. Thus we conclude that the sensitivity of the ac input is 0.45 times the sensitivity of dc input in case of <a href="../half-wave-diode-rectifier/index.html"  >half wave rectifier</a>.<br />
<div id="attachment_8758" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 464px"><img src="../images/half-wave-rectifier-waveform-25.11.13.gif" alt="Half Wave Rectifier Waveform" width="454" height="357" class="size-full wp-image-8758" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Half Wave Rectifier Waveform</p></div></p>
<h2 id="Full-Wave-Rectifier-Circuits-of-Rectifier-Type-Instruments">Full Wave Rectifier Circuits of Rectifier Type Instruments</h2>
<p> Let us consider a circuit given below.<br />
<div id="attachment_8759" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 423px"><img src="../images/full-wave-bridge-rectifier-25.11.13.gif" alt="full wave bridge rectifier" width="413" height="358" class="size-full wp-image-8759" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Full Wave Bridge Rectifier</p></div><br />
We have used here a bridge rectifier circuit as shown. Again we divide our operation into two parts. In the first we analyze the output by applying the dc <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a> and in another we will apply ac <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> to the circuit. A series multiplier <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is connected in series with the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html"  >voltage source</a> which has the same function as described above. Let us consider first case here we applying dc <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  to the circuit. Now the value of full scale deflection  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in this case is again V/(R+R1), where V is the root mean square value of the applied voltage, R is the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> multiplier and R<sub>1</sub> which is the electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the instrument. The R and R<sub>1</sub> are marked in the circuit diagram. Now let us consider second case, in this case we will apply ac sinusoidal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a> to the circuit which is given v=Vmsin(wt) where Vm is the peak value of the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html"  >voltage</a> again if we calculate the value of full scale deflection  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in this case by applying the similar procedure then we will get an expression of full scale  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  as .9V/(R+R1).Remember in order to obtain the average value of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> we should integrate the instantaneous expression of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> from zero to pi . Thus comparing it dc output we conclude that the sensitivity with ac input <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html"  >voltage source</a> is 0.9 times the as in the case of dc input <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a> .<br />
<div id="attachment_8760" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 488px"><img src="../images/full-wave-rectifier-waveform-25.11.13.gif" alt="full wave rectifier waveform" width="478" height="380" class="size-full wp-image-8760" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Full Wave Rectifier Waveform</p></div><br />
The output wave is shown below. Now we are going to discuss the factors which affect the performance of Rectifier type instruments:</p>
<p>(a) Effect of input waveforms: Rectifier type of instruments is calibrated in terms of root mean square values of sinusoidal wave of voltages and current. The problem is that the input waveform may or may not have same form factor on which the scale of these meter is calibrated.<br />
(b) There may be some error due to the rectifier circuit as we not included the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the rectifier bridge circuits in both the case. The non linear characteristics of bridge may distort the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> waveform.<br />
(c) There may variation in the temperature due to which the electrical <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of the bridge changes hence in order to compensate this kind of errors we should apply multiplier <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> with high temperature coefficient .<br />
(d) Effect of <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitance</a>  of the bridge rectifier: Bridge rectifier has imperfect <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitance</a>  thus due to this it byp asses the high frequency currents. Hence there is decrement in the reading.<br />
(e) The sensitivity of Rectifier type instruments is low in case of ac input voltage.</p>
<h2 id="Advantages-of-Rectifier-Type-Instruments">Advantages of Rectifier Type Instruments</h2>
<p>Following are the advantages of the rectifier type of instruments:<br />
(a) The accuracy of rectifier type instrument is about 5 percent under normal operating condition.<br />
(b) The frequency range of operation can be extended to high value.<br />
(c) They have uniform scale on the meter.<br />
(d) They have low operating value of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and voltages.</p>
<p>The loading effect of an ac rectifier voltmeter in both the cases (i.e. <a href="../half-wave-diode-rectifier/index.html"  >half wave <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> rectifier</a> and <a href="../full-wave-diode-rectifier/index.html"  >full wave <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> rectifier</a>) is high as compared to the loading effects of dc voltmeters as the sensitivity of the voltmeter either using in half wave or full wave rectification is less than the sensitivity of dc voltmeters.</p>
