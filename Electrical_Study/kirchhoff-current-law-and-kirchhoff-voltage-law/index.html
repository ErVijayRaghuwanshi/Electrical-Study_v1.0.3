<h2 id="Kirchhoff's-Laws">Kirchhoff's Laws</h2>
<p>There are some simple relationships between <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>s and voltages of different branches of an electrical circuit. These relationships are determined by some basic laws that are known as <strong>Kirchhoff laws</strong> or more specifically Kirchhoff Current and Voltage laws. These laws are very helpful in determining the equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> or impedance (in case of AC) of a complex network and the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>s flowing in the various branches of the network. These laws are first derived by Guatov Robert Kirchhoff and hence these laws are also referred as <strong>Kirchhoff Laws</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Kirchhoff's-Current-Law">Kirchhoff's Current Law</h2>
<p>In an electrical circuit, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> flows rationally as electrical quantity. As the flow of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> is considered as flow of quantity, at any point in the circuit the total <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> enters, is exactly equal to the total  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  leaves the point. The point may be considered anywhere in the circuit.<br />
<img src="../images01/kirchhoff-current-law.gif" width="300" height="250" alt="kirchhoff  current law" /></p>
<p>Suppose the point is on the conductor through which the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> is flowing, then the same <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> crosses the point which can alternatively said that the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  enters at the point and same will leave the point. As we said the point may be anywhere on the circuit, so it can also be a junction point in the circuit. So total quantity of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  enters at the junction point must be exactly equal to total quantity of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  that leaves the junction. This is the very basic thing about flowing of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> and fortunately <strong>Kirchhoff Current law</strong> says the same. The law is also known as <strong>Kirchhoff First Law</strong> and this law stated that, at any junction point in the electrical circuit, the summation of all the branch <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>s is zero. If we consider all the currents enter in the junction are considered as positive current, then convention of all the branch currents leaving the junction are negative. Now if we add all these positive and negative signed currents, obviously we will get result of zero.<br />
The mathematical form of <strong>Kirchhoff's Current Law</strong> is as follows,</p>
</p>
<p>We have a junction where n number of beaches meet together.</p>
<p>Let's I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>, ...................... I<sub>m</sub> are the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of branches 1, 2, 3, ......m and</p>
<p>I<sub>m + 1</sub>, I<sub>m + 2</sub>, I<sub>m + 3</sub>, ...................... I<sub>n</sub> are the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of branches m + 1, m + 2, m + 3, ......n respectively.</p>
<p>The currents in branches 1, 2, 3 ....m are entering to the junction.</p>
<p>Whereas currents in branches m + 1, m + 2, m + 3 ....n are leaving from the junction.</p>
<p>So the currents in the branches 1, 2, 3 ....m may be considered as positive as per general convention and similarly the currents in the branches m + 1, m + 2, m + 3 ....n may be considered as negative.</p>
<p>Hence all the branch currents in respect of the said junction are - </p>
<p>+ I<sub>1</sub>, + I<sub>2</sub>, + I<sub>3</sub>,................+ I<sub>m</sub>, &minus; I<sub>m + 1</sub>, &minus; I<sub>m + 2</sub>, &minus; I<sub>m + 3</sub>, .................. and &minus; I<sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p>Now, the summation of all currents at the junction is-</p>
<p>I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>3</sub> + ................+ I<sub>m</sub> &minus; I<sub>m + 1</sub> &minus; I<sub>m + 2</sub> &minus; I<sub>m + 3</sub>..................&minus; I<sub>n</sub>. </p>
<p>This is equal to zero according to Kirchhoff Current Law.</p>
<p>Therefore, I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>3</sub> + ................+ I<sub>m</sub> &minus; I<sub>m + 1</sub> &minus; I<sub>m + 2</sub> &minus; I<sub>m + 3</sub>..................&minus; I<sub>n</sub> = 0.</p>
<p>The mathematical form of <strong>Kirchhoff First Law</strong> is &sum; I = 0 at any junction of electrical network.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_277" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 468px"><a href="../kirchhoff-current-law-and-kirchhoff-voltage-law/kirchhoff-voltage-law/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-277"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/kirchhoff-voltage-law.gif" alt="kirchhoff voltage law" width="458" height="344" class="size-full wp-image-277" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kirchhoff Voltage Law</p></div><br />
This law deals with the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops at various branches in an electrical circuit. Think about one point on a closed loop in an electrical circuit. If someone goes to any other point on the same loop, he or she will find that   the potential at that second point may be different from first point. If he or she continues to go to some different point in the loop, he or she may find some different potential at that new location. If he or she goes on further along that closed loop, ultimately he or she reaches the initial point from where the journey was started. That means, he or she comes back to the same potential point after crossing through different <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> levels. It can be alternatively said that net <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> gain and net <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops along a closed loop are equal. That is what <strong>Kirchhoff Voltage law</strong> states. This law is alternatively known as <strong>Kirchhoff Second Law</strong>.</p>
<p>If we consider a closed loop conventionally, if we consider all the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> gains along the loop are positive then all the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops along the loop should be considered as negative. The summation of all these voltages in a closed loop is equal to zero. Suppose n numbers of back to back connected elements form a closed loop. Among these circuit elements m number elements are <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html">voltage source</a> and n - m number of elements drop <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> such as <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s.</p>
<p>The voltages of sources are V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>,................... V<sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p>And <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops across the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s respectively, V<sub>m + 1</sub>, V<sub>m + 2</sub>,  V<sub>m + 3</sub>,..................... V<sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p>As it is said that the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> gain conventionally considered as positive, and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops are considered as negative, the voltages along the closed loop are -</p>
<p>+ V<sub>1</sub>, + V<sub>2</sub>, + V<sub>3</sub>,................... + V<sub>m</sub>, &minus; V<sub>m + 1</sub>,  &minus; V<sub>m + 2</sub>,  &minus; V<sub>m + 3</sub>,.....................&minus; V<sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p>Now according to <strong>Kirchhoff Voltage law</strong>, the summation of all these voltages results to zero.</p>
<p>That means,  V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub> + V<sub>3</sub> + ................... + V<sub>m</sub> &minus; V<sub>m + 1</sub> &minus; V<sub>m + 2</sub> &minus; V<sub>m + 3</sub> + .....................&minus; V<sub>n</sub> = 0.</p>
<p>So accordingly <strong>Kirchhoff Second Law</strong>, &sum;V = 0.</p>
<h3 id="Application-of-Kirchhoff's-Laws-to-Circuits">Application of Kirchhoff's Laws to Circuits</h3>
<p>The  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  distribution in various branches of a circuit can easily be found out by applying Kirchhoff Current law at different nodes or junction points in the circuit. After that Kirchhoff Voltage law is applied, each possible loop in the circuit generates algebraic equation for every loop. By solving all these equations, one can easily find out different unknown currents, voltages and <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s in the circuits.</p>

<p>1) The resistive drops in a loop due to  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing in clockwise direction must be taken as positive drops.</p>
<p>2) The resistive drops in a loop due to  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing in anti-clockwise direction must be taken as negative drops.</p>
