<p>In 1947 J. Barden, W. Bratterin and W. Shockley invented transistor. The term transistor was given by John R. Pierce. Through initially it was called the solid state version of the vacuum triode, but the term transistor has survived. As we will go through the topic, we will know about the transistor, mainly <strong>bipolar junction transistor</strong> or <strong>BJT</strong>. Nowadays the use of BJT’s has declined towards CMOS technology in the design of IC’s. The word “transistor” is derived from the words “Transfer” &#038; “Resistor” it describes the operation of a BJT i.e. the transfer of an input signal from a low <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> circuit to a high <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> circuit. This type of transistor is made up of <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" >semiconductors</a>. We know that silicon (Si) &amp; Germanium (Ge) are the examples of <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" >semiconductors</a>. Now, why this is called junction transistor? The answer lies behind the construction. We already know what is p - type and n - type semiconductors. Now, in this type of transistor any one type of semiconductors is sandwiched between the other type of semiconductor. For example, an n - type can be sandwiched between two p - type semiconductors or similarly one p - type can be sandwiched between two n - type semiconductors. These are called p - n - p and n - p - n transistors respectively. We will discuss about them later. Now as there are two junctions of different types of semiconductors, this is called junction transistor. It’s called “bipolar” because the conduction takes place due to both electrons as well as holes.  </p>
<h2 id="Definition-of-BJT">Definition of BJT</h2>
<p>A bipolar junction transistor is a three terminal <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> device consisting of two p-n junctions which is able to amplify or “magnify” a signal. It is a  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  controlled device. The three terminals of the BJT are the base, the collector and the emitter. A signal of small amplitude if applied to the base is available in the amplified form at the collector of the transistor. This is the amplification provided by the BJT. Note that it does require an external source of DC power supply to carry out the amplification process.</p>
</p>
<p>The basic diagrams of the two types of bipolar junction transistors mentioned above are given below.<br />
<a href="../bipolar-junction-transistor-or-bjt-n-p-n-or-p-n-p-transistor/bipoler-junction-transistor/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-4838"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4838" alt="Bipolar Junction Transistor or BJT " src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bipoler-junction-transistor.gif" /></a></p>
<p>From the above figure, we can see that every BJT has three parts named emitter, base and collector. J<sub>E</sub> and J<sub>C</sub> represent junction of emitter and junction of collector respectively. Now initially it is sufficient for us to know that emitter based junction is forward biased and collector base junctions is reverse biased. The next topic will describe the two types of this transistors.</p>
<h2 id="N-P-N-Bipolar-Junction-Transistor">N-P-N Bipolar Junction Transistor</h2>
<p>As started before in <strong>n - p - n bipolar transistor</strong> one p - type <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> resides between two n - type semiconductors the diagram below a n - p - n transistor is shown</p>

<p>Similarly for <strong>p - n - p bipolar junction transistor</strong> a n-type semiconductors is sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors. The diagram of a p - n - p transistor is shown below</p>

<h3 id="Working-Principle-of-BJT">Working Principle of BJT</h3>
<p>Figure shows an n-p-n transistor biased in the active region (See transistor biasing), the BE junction is forward biased whereas the CB junction is reversed biased. The width of the depletion region of the BE junction is small as compared to that of the CB junction. The forward bias at the BE junction reduces the barrier potential and causes the electrons to flow from the emitter to base. As the base is thin and lightly doped it consists of very few holes so some of the electrons from the emitter (about 2%) recombine with the holes present in the base region and flow out of the base terminal. This constitutes the base current, it flows due to recombination of electrons and holes (Note that the direction of conventional  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow is opposite to that of flow of electrons). The remaining large number of electrons will cross the reverse biased collector junction to constitute the collector current. Thus by KCL,<br />
<img src='1.png' id="latexI_E%5C%3B%3D%20%5C%3BI_B%5C%3B%2B%20%5C%3BI_C&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='I_E\;= \;I_B\;+ \;I_C' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='I_E\;= \;I_B\;+ \;I_C' /><br />
The base  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is very small as compared to emitter and collector current.<br />
<img src='2.png' id="latexTherefore%2C%5C%3B%20I_E%5C%3B%20%5Csim%20%5C%3B%20%20I_C&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='Therefore,\; I_E\; \sim \;  I_C' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='Therefore,\; I_E\; \sim \;  I_C' /><br />
Here, the majority charge carriers are electrons. The operation of a p-n-p transistor is same as of the n-p-n, the only difference is that the majority charge carriers are holes instead of electrons. Only a small part  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows due to majority carriers and most of the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows due to minority charge carriers in a BJT. Hence, they are called as minority carrier devices.</p>
<h3 id="Equivalent-Circuit-of-BJT">Equivalent Circuit of BJT</h3>
<p>A p-n junction is represented by a diode. As a transistor has two p-n junctions, it is equivalent to two diodes connected back to back. This is called as the two <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> analogy of the BJT.</p>
<h2 id="Bipolar-Junction-Transistors-Characteristics">Bipolar Junction Transistors Characteristics</h2>
<p>The three parts of a BJT are collector, emitter and base. Before knowing about the <strong>bipolar junction transistor characteristics</strong>, we have to know about the modes of operation for this type of transistors. The modes are<br />
i) Common Base (CB) mode</p>
<p>ii) Common Emitter (CE) mode</p>
<p>iii) Common Collector (CC) mode</p>
<p>All three types of modes are shown below</p>
<div id="attachment_4841" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 750px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bjt-biasing.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4841" alt="biasing of bjt" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bjt-biasing.png" width="740" height="222" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">a) Common base (CB) mode b) Common emitter (CE) mode c) Common collector (CC) mode</p></div>
<p>Now coming to the <strong>characteristics of BJT</strong> there are different characteristics for different modes of operation. Characteristics is nothing but the graphical forms of relationships among different  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> variables of the transistor. The <strong>characteristics for p - n - p transistors</strong> are given for different modes and different parameters.</p>
<h4 id="Common-Base-Characteristics">Common Base Characteristics</h4>
<h5 id="Input-Characteristics">Input Characteristics</h5>
<p>For p - n - p transistor, the input  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is the emitter  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  (I<sub>E</sub>) and the input <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is the collector base <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (V<sub>CB</sub>).</p>
<div id="attachment_4842" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 664px"><a href="../bipolar-junction-transistor-or-bjt-n-p-n-or-p-n-p-transistor/cb-input-characteristics/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-4842"><img class="size-full wp-image-4842" alt="Characteristics of p-n-p Transistor " src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cb-input-characteristics.png" width="654" height="382" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Common Base Input Characteristics of p-n-p Transistor</p></div>
<p>As the emitter - base junction is forward biased, therefore the graph of I<sub>E</sub> Vs V<sub>EB</sub> is similar to the forward characteristics of a p - n diode. I<sub>E</sub> increases for fixed V<sub>EB</sub> when V<sub>CB</sub> increases.</p>
<h5 id="Output-Characteristics">Output Characteristics</h5>
<p>The output characteristics shows the relation between output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and output  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>C</sub> is the output  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and collector – base <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and the emitter  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>E</sub> is the input  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and works as the parameters. The figure below shows the output characteristics for a p - n - p transistor in CB mode.</p>
<div id="attachment_4856" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 736px"><a href="../?attachment_id=4856" rel="attachment wp-att-4856"><img class="size-full wp-image-4856" alt="Characteristics of p-n-p Transistor" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cb-output-characteristics.gif" width="726" height="424" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Common Base Output Characteristics of p-n-p Transistor</p></div>
<p>As we know for p - n - p transistors I<sub>E</sub> and V<sub>EB</sub> are positive and I<sub>C</sub>, I<sub>B</sub>, V<sub>CB</sub> are negative. These are three regions in the curve, active region saturation region and the cut off region. The active region is the region where the transistor operates normally. Here the emitter junction is reverse biased. Now the saturation region is the region where both the emitter collector junctions are forward biased. And finally the cut off region is the region where both emitter and the collector junctions are reverse biased.</p>
<h4 id="Common-Emitter-Characteristics">Common Emitter Characteristics</h4>
<p>Input characteristics</p>
<p>I<sub>B</sub> (Base Current) is the input current, V<sub>BE</sub> (Base - Emitter Voltage) is the input <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> for CE (Common Emitter) mode. So, the input characteristics for CE mode will be the relation between I<sub>B</sub> and V<sub>BE</sub> with V<sub>CE</sub> as parameter. The characteristics are shown below</p>
<div id="attachment_4844" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 664px"><a href="../bipolar-junction-transistor-or-bjt-n-p-n-or-p-n-p-transistor/ce-input-characteristics/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-4844"><img class="size-full wp-image-4844" alt="input characteristics of BJT" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ce-input-characteristics.png" width="654" height="382" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Common Emitter (CE) mode input characteristics of BJT</p></div>
<p>The typical CE input characteristics are similar to that of a forward biased of p - n diode. But as V<sub>CB</sub> increases the base width decreases.</p>
<p>Output characteristics</p>
<p>Output characteristics for CE mode is the curve or graph between collector  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  (I<sub>C</sub>) and collector - emitter <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (V<sub>CE</sub>) when the base  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>B</sub> is the parameter. The characteristics is shown below in the figure.</p>
<div id="attachment_4845" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 664px"><a href="../bipolar-junction-transistor-or-bjt-n-p-n-or-p-n-p-transistor/ce-output-characteristics/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-4845"><img class="size-full wp-image-4845" alt="Characteristics of p - n - p transistor " src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ce-output-characteristics.png" width="654" height="382" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Common Emitter Output Characteristics of p - n - p transistor</p></div>
<p>Like the output characteristics of common - base transistor CE mode has also three regions named (i) Active region, (ii) cut-off regions, (iii) saturation region. The active region has collector region reverse biased and the emitter junction forward biased. For cut-off region the emitter junction is slightly reverse biased and the collector  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is not totally cut-off. And finally for saturation region both the collector and the emitter junction are forward biased.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-BJT">Application of BJT</h2>
<p>BJT's are used in discrete circuit designed due to availability of many types, and obviously because of its high transconductane and output <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> which is better than MOSFET. BJT's are suitable for high frequency application also. That’s why they are used in radio frequency for wireless systems. Another application of BJT can be stated as small signal amplifier, metal proximity photocell, etc.</p>
<h3 id="Bipolar-Junction-Transistor-Amplifier">Bipolar Junction Transistor Amplifier</h3>
<p>To understand the concept of <strong>Bipolar Junction Transistor Amplifier</strong>, we should look through the diagram of a p-n-p transistor first.</p>
<div id="attachment_4847" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 762px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bjt-amplifier.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-4847" alt="Bipolar Junction Transistor Amplifier" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bjt-amplifier.gif" width="752" height="281" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bipolar Junction Transistor Amplifier</p></div>
<p>Now as the input <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is changed a little, say ΔV<sub>i</sub> of the emitter - base <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> changes the barrier height and the emitter  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  by ΔI<sub>E</sub>. This change in emitter  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  develops a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop ΔV<sub>O</sub> across the load <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R<sub>L</sub>, where,</p>
<p>ΔV<sub>O</sub> = - R<sub>L</sub>ΔI<sub>C</sub></p>
<p>ΔV<sub>O</sub> gives the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the amplifier. There is a negative sign because of the collector  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  gives a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop across R<sub>L</sub> with polarity opposite to the reference polarity. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> gain A<sub>V</sub> for the amplifier is given the ratio between the output voltages ΔV<sub>O</sub> to the input <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ΔV<sub>i</sub>, so,</p>
<p><img alt=" " src="../equations/bjt-1.gif" /></p>
<p>ΔI<sub>C</sub> / ΔI<sub>E</sub> = A<sub>I</sub> is called the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  gain ratio of the transistor. From the figure diagram shown above we can see that an increase in the emitter <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> reduces the forward bias at the emitter junction thus decreases the collector current. It indicates that the output <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and the input <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> are in phase. Now, finally the power gain Ap of the transistor is the ratio between the output power and the input power</p>
