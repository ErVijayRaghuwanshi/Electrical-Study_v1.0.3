Protection of a device is an important aspect for its reliable and efficient operation. <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> is a very delicate <a href="../theory-of-semiconductor/index.html" title="Theory of Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> device. So we have to use it in its specified ratings to get desired output. <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> may face different types of threats during its operation due to over voltages, over currents etc. There are different types of <strong>thyristor protection</strong> schemes available for satisfactory operation of the device like</p>
<p><span class="Red">1) Over voltage protection.<br />
2) Over current protection.<br />
3) High dv/dt protection.<br />
4) High di/dt protection.<br />
5) Thermal protection.</span></p>
<h3>Over Voltage Protection :</h3>
<p>It is the most important protection scheme w. r. t. others as <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Appilication Types Construction Principle of Thyristor">thyristors</a> are very sensitive to over voltages. Maximum time <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> failures happen due to over-voltage transients.</p>
<p>A <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> may be subjected to internal or external over-voltages.<br />
<span class="Red">Internal Over-Voltages :</span> After commutation of a <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> reverse recovery current decays abruptly with high di/dt which causes a high reverse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> [as, V = L(di/dt) so if di/dt is high then V will be large] that can exceed the rated break-over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and the device may be damaged.</p>
<p><span class="Red">External Over-Voltages :</span> These are caused due to various reasons in the supply line like lightning, surge conditions (abnormal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> spike) etc. External over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> may cause different types of problem in <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> operation like increase in leakage current, permanent breakdown of junctions, unwanted turn-on of devices etc. So, we have to suppress the over-voltages.</p>
<p><span class="Green">Protective Measure :</span> The effect of over-voltages can be minimized by using non-linear <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s called <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> clamping devices like metal oxide like metal oxide varistor. At the time of normal operation it offers high impedance and acts as it is not present in the circuit. But when the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> exceeds the rated <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> then it serves as a low impedance path to protect SCR.</p>
</p>
<h3>Over Current Protection</h3>
<p>Over current mainly occurs due to different types of faults in the circuit. Due to over current i<sup>2</sup>R loss will increase and high generation of heat may take place that can exceed the permissible limit and burn the device. </p>
<p><span class="Green">Protective Measure :</span> <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> can be protected from over current by using CB and fast acting current limiting fuses (FACLF). CB are used for protection of <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> against continuous overloads or against surge currents of long duration as a CB has long tripping time. But fast-acting fuses is used for protecting <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> against high surge current of very short duration.</p>
<h3>High dv/dt Protection</h3>
<p>When a <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> is in forward blocking state then only J<sub>2</sub> junction is reverse biased which acts as a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> having constant <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitance</a>  value C<sub>j</sub> (junction capacitance). As we know that current through <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> follows the relation<br />
<img src='1.png' id="latexi%3DC%5Cfeac%7Bdv%7D%7Bdt%7D%5CRightarrow%20i%5Cpropto%20%5Cfrac%7Bdv%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%28if%20%5C%3BC%5C%3B%20constant%29&amp;bg=DDDDDD&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1" title='i=C\feac{dv}{dt}\Rightarrow i\propto \frac{dv}{dt} (if \;C\; constant)' style='vertical-align:1%' class='tex' alt='i=C\feac{dv}{dt}\Rightarrow i\propto \frac{dv}{dt} (if \;C\; constant)' /><br />
Hence leakage current through the J<sub>2</sub> junction which is nothing but the leakage current through the device will increase with the increase in dv<sub>a</sub>/dt i.e. rate of change of applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the thyristor. This current can turn-on the device even when the gate signal is absent. This is called dv/dt triggering and must be avoided which can be achieved by using Snubber circuit in parallel with the device.</p>
<p><span class="Green">Protective Measure :</span><br />
<span class="Red">Snubber Circuit :</span> It consists of a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> connected in series with a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> which is applied parallel with the thyristor, when S is closed then <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V<sub>s</sub> is applied across the device as well as C<sub>s</sub> suddenly. At first Snubber circuit behaves like a short circuit. Therefore <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the device is zero. Gradually <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across C<sub>s</sub> builds up at a slow rate. So dv/dt across the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> will stay in allowable range.</p>
<p>	Before turning on of <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> C<sub>s</sub> is fully charged and after turning on of <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> it discharges through the SCR. This discharging current can be limited with the help of a resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) connected in series with the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> (C<sub>s</sub>) to keep the value of current and rate of change of current in a safe limit.</p>
<h3>High di/dt Protection</h3>
<p>When a <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> is turned on by gate pulse then charge carriers spread through its junction rapidly. But if rate of rise of anode current, i.e. di/dt is greater than the spreading of charge carriers then localized heat generation will take place which is known as local hot spots. This may damage the thyristor. </p>
<p><span class="Green">Protective Measure :</span> To avoid local hot spots we use an <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> in series with the device as it prevents high rate of change of current through it.</p>
<h3>High Temperature Protection</h3>
<p>With the increase in the temperature of the junction, insulation may get failed. So we have to take proper measures to limit the temperature rise. </p>
<p><span class="Green">Protective Measure :</span> We can achieve this by mounting the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> on heat sink which is mainly made by high thermal conductivity metals like aluminium (Al), Copper (Cu) etc. Mainly aluminium (Al) is used due to its low cost. There are several types of mounting techniques for <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> such as – Lead-mounting, stud-mounting, Bolt-down mounting, press-fit mounting, press-pack mounting etc.</p>
<h2>Gate Protection of Thyristor</h2>
<p>Like thyristor, Gate circuit should also be protected from over voltages and over currents. Over voltages in the gate circuit can cause false triggering and over current can cause high junction temperature.</p>
<p><span class="Green">Protective Measure :</span> Over voltages <strong>thyristor protection</strong> is achieved by using a zener <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> and a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> can be used to protect the gate circuit from over current. Noise in gate circuit can also cause false triggering which can be avoided by using a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> and a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> in parallel. A <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> (D) may be connected in series or in parallel with the gate to protect it from high reverse voltage.</p>
<h2>Overall Protection of a Thyristor</h2>
<p>Lead mounting : In such mounting technique housing of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> itself is used as heat radiator. Hence no need of additional heat zink arrangement. Hence, this technique of <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> Protection is generally used for low current application, normally less than one ampere.</p>
<p><span class="Green">Stud mounting :</span> The anode of the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> is in the form of threaded stud which is screwed to a metalling heat sink block.</p>
<p><span class="Green">Bolt-down mounting :</span> Here the device is connected to the heat sink with the help of nut-bolt mechanism. It is mainly used in small and medium rating circuit.</p>
<p><span class="Green">Press fit mounting :</span> This kind of mounting is obtained by inserting the whole <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="Silicon Controlled Rectifier">SCR</a> into the metallic block. It is used in high rating circuit.</p>
<p><span class="Green">Press-Pack mounting :</span> This kind of mounting for <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> protection is obtained by sandwiching the <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> between to heat sink with the help of clamps. It is used for very high rating circuit. </p>
