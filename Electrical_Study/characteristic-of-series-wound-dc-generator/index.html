<p>In these types of generators the field windings, armature windings and external load circuit all are connected in series as shown in figure below.<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/series-wound-dc-generator-25.10.13.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/series-wound-dc-generator-25.10.13.png" alt="Series Wound DC Generator" width="383" height="277" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7876" /></a><br />
Therefore, the same  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through armature winding, field winding and the load.</p>
<p>Let, I = I<sub>a</sub> = I<sub>sc</sub> = I<sub>L</sub><br />
Here, I<sub>a</sub> = armature current<br />
      I<sub>sc</sub> = series field current<br />
      I<sub>L</sub> = load current</p>
<p>There are generally three most important <strong>characteristics of series wound DC generator</strong> which show the relation between various quantities such as series field  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or excitation current, generated voltage, terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and load current.</p>
<h2 id="Magnetic_or_Open_Circuit_Characteristic_of_Series_Wound_DC_Generator">Magnetic or Open Circuit Characteristic of Series Wound DC Generator</h2>
<p>The curve which shows the relation between no load <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and the field excitation  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is called <strong>magnetic or open circuit characteristic curve</strong>. As during no load, the load terminals are open circuited, there will be no field  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the field since, the armature, field and load are series connected and these three make a closed loop of circuit. So, this curve can be obtained practically be separating the field winding and exciting the <a href="../principle-of-dc-generator/index.html"  >DC generator</a> by an external source. Here in the diagram below AB curve is showing the magnetic <strong>characteristic of <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Series_Wound_Generator"  >series wound DC generator</a></strong>. The linearity of the curve will continue till the saturation of the poles. After that there will be no further significant change of terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of <a href="../principle-of-dc-generator/index.html"  >DC generator</a> for increasing field current. Due to residual magnetism there will be a small initial <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the armature that is why the curve started from a point A which is a little way up to the origin O.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Internal_Characteristic_of_Series_Wound_DC_Generator">Internal Characteristic of Series Wound DC Generator</h2>
<p>The <strong>internal characteristic</strong> curve gives the relation between <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> generated in the armature and the load current. This curve is obtained by subtracting the drop due to the demagnetizing effect of armature reaction from the no load voltage. So, the actual generated <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ( E<sub>g</sub>) will be less than the no load <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (E<sub>0</sub>). That is why the curve is slightly dropping from the open circuit characteristic curve. Here in the diagram below OC curve is showing the internal characteristic or total characteristic of the series wound DC generator.</p>
<h2 id="External_Characteristic_of_Series_Wound_DC_Generator">External Characteristic of Series Wound DC Generator</h2>
<p>The external characteristic curve shows the variation of terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (V) with the load current  ( I<sub>L</sub>). Terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of this type of generator is obtained by subtracting the ohomic drop due to armature <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> (R<sub>a</sub>) and series field <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> ( R<sub>sc</sub>) from the actually generated <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ( E<sub>g</sub>).</p>
<p>Terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V = E<sub>g</sub> - I(R<sub>a</sub> + R<sub>sc</sub>)</p>
<p>The external characteristic curve lies below the internal characteristic curve because the value of terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is less than the generated voltage. Here in the figure OD curve is showing the external characteristic of the <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Series_Wound_Generator"  >series wound DC generator</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../characteristic-of-series-wound-dc-generator/characteristics-dc-series-generator/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-7880"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/characteristics-dc-series-generator.png" alt="characteristics dc series generator" width="600" height="441" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7880" /></a></p>
<p>It can be observed from the characteristics of <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Series_Wound_Generator"  >series wound DC generator</a>, that with the increase in load (load is increased when load current  increases) the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the machine increases. But after reaching its maximum value it starts to decrease due to excessive demagnetizing effect of armature reaction. This phenomenon is shown in the figure by the dotted line. Dotted portion of the characteristic gives approximately constant  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  irrespective of the external load <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. This is because if load is increased, the field  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is increased as field is series connected with load. Similarly if load is increased, armature  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is increased as the armature is also series connected with load. But due to saturation, there will be no further significance raise of <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> strength hence any further increase in induced voltage. But due to increased armature current, the affect of armature reaction increases significantly which causes significant fall in load voltage. If load <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> falls, the load current  is also decreased proportionally since  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is proportional to <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> as per <a href="../ohms-law-equation-formula-and-limitation-of-ohms-law/index.html" title="Ohm’s Law">Ohm’s law</a> . So, increasing load, tends to increase the load current, but decreasing load voltage, tends to decrease load current. Due these two simultaneous effects, there will be no significant change in load current  in dotted portion of external characteristics of series wound DC generator. That is why <a href="../types-of-dc-generators/#Series_Wound_Generator"  >series DC generator</a> is called constant  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  DC generator.</p>
