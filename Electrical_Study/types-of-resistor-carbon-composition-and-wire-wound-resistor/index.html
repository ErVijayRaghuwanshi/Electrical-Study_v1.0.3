<h2 id="Definition-of-Resistor">Definition of Resistor</h2>
<p>A <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> offers resistance to the flow of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> . The resistance is the measure of opposition to the flow of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. More resistance means more opposition to  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> . The unit of resistance is ohm and it is represented as &ohm;. When one volt potential difference is applied across a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> and for that one ampere of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through it, the resistance of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is said to be one &ohm;. Resistor is one of the most essential passive elements in electrical and electronics engineering.  </p>
<h2 id="Resistor">Resistor</h2>
<p>It is some time required to introduce electrical resistance in different circuit to limit the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> through it. <strong>Resistor</strong> is an element of circuit which does the same. Such as series connected <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> limits the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing through the light emitting <a href="../diode-working-principle-and-types-of-diode/index.html" title="Working Principle and Types of Diode">diode</a> (LED). In addition to that <strong>resistors</strong> serve many other purposes in electrical and electronic applications.</p>
</p>
<p>The most essential requirement of a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is that its value of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> should not vary with temperature for a wide range. That means <a href="../resistance-variation-with-temperature/index.html" >resistance variation with temperature</a> must be as minimal as possible for a wide range of temperature. In other word the <a href="../temperature-coefficient-of-resistance/index.html" >temperature coefficient of resistance</a> of must be minimum for the materials by which a <strong>resistor</strong> is made of.</p>
<h3 id="High-Frequency-Effects-on-Resistor">High Frequency Effects on Resistor</h3>
<p>The effective <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> value of a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> may be changed when it is subjected to alternating voltage. Not only that the value of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> varies with variation of frequency of supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a>.  This change of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> with frequency is called Boella effect. Actually it is not practically possible to make an ideal <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. Practically it may have some <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> and <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitance</a>  in addition to its <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>. Therefore, the value of impedance of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> may vary with frequency. That is why a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is referred to be used within its useful frequency range. Useful frequency range is defined as the highest frequency limit beyond which the impedance of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> crosses its tolerance value. </p>
<p>High frequency effect on <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> depends upon its constructional feature. The impedance of wire-wound <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> increases with frequency. On the other hand composition <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> reduces its impedance with increasing frequency.  The impedance of film <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s does not change up to 100 MHz and then it decreases. Film <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s have the most stable high-frequency performance.</p>
<p>The high frequency response of a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> may also depend up to some extend on diameter of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>.  It is seen that smaller diameter <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> has better frequency response. Because of that the length – diameter ration of high-frequency <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s is between 4:1 to 10:1. </p>
<h3 id="Voltage-Coefficient-of-Resistance">Voltage Coefficient of Resistance</h3>
<p>The <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> may also vary sometime with applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across it. This change is expressed as a percentage of the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> at 10% of rated voltage. Thus the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> coefficient of resistance is give by </p>

<h3 id="Noise-of-a-Resistor">Noise of a Resistor</h3>
<p>Noise in a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is caused by its applied voltage, its physical dimensions, and materials by which it is made of. The noise includes Johnson noise, noise due to flow of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>, noise due to cracked bodies, and noise due to loosen end caps and leads of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. For variable <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s the noise can also be caused by the jumping of a moving contact over turns and by an imperfect electrical path between the contact and <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> element. </p>
<p>Johnson noise is thermal noise. This noise depends upon temperature but does not depend upon frequencies. As this noise is same for all frequencies it is referred as “white noise”.  The magnitude of thermal noise is given by,</p>
<p><center><img src="../equations/types of resistor-03-07-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Where, E<sub>RMS</sub> is the value of the noise <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (V) in rms, R is the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> measured in ohm, k is Boltzmann constant (1.38 X 10<sup> – 23</sup> J/K), T is the temperature measured in Kelvin, and &Delta;f is the bandwidth in Hz over which the noise energy is measured.</p>
<h3 id="Power-Rating-of-Resistor">Power Rating of Resistor</h3>
<p>When <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> passes through a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> there would be I<sup>2</sup>R loss and hence as per Joules law of heating there must be temperature rise in the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. A <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> must be operated within a temperature limit so that there should not be any permanent damage due high temperature. The power rating of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is defined as the maximum power that a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> can dissipate in form of heat to maintain the temperature within maximum allowable limit. How much power a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> will dissipate depends upon material, dimensions, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rating, maximum temperature limit of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> and ambient temperature. </p>
<h3 id="Voltage-Rating-of-Resistor">Voltage Rating of Resistor</h3>
<p>This rating is defined as the maximum <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> that can be applied across a <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> due to which power dissipation will be within its allowable limit.  Actually <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rating of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is related to the power rating. As we know that power rating of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is expressed as </p>
<p><center><img src="../equations/types of resistor-02-07-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Where V is the applied <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> and R is the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> value of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> in ohms.<br />
From above equation it is clear that for limiting P, V must be limited for a particular <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R.  This V is <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> rating of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> of power rating P watts and <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R &Omega;.</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Resistor">Types of Resistor</h2>
<p>There are different <strong>types of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong> depending upon their construction, power dissipation capacities and tolerance of the value. Such as</p>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Carbon Composition Resistor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Metal Film Resistor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Carbon Film Resistor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Non Linear Resistor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Varistor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Thermistor</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Carbon-Composition-Resistor">Carbon Composition Resistor</h3>
<p>These <strong>types of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong> are very commonly used low cost <strong>resistor</strong>. The construction of <strong>carbon composition <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong> is very simple. It is also commonly referred as <strong>carbon <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong>. It is mainly made of carbon clay composition covered with a plastic case. The lead of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is made of tinned copper. The main advantages of these <strong>resistors</strong> are that they are easily available in local market in very low cost and they are very durable too. But the main disadvantage is that they are very much temperature sensitive. These <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are available in wide range of values. It is available in as low as 1 &Omega; value and it is also available in as high as 22 Mega &Omega; value. The tolerance range in resistance of <strong>carbon composition <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong> is of  &plusmn; 5 to &plusmn; 20 %. Such <strong>resistor</strong> has a tendency of electric noise due to passage of <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electrical current</a> from one carbon particle to other. Where low cost is the main criteria of designing a circuit rather than it's performance, these <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are normally used.</p>
<p>These carbon <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are provided with different colored band on their cylindrical body. These color bands are code for the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> values of carbon composition <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> along with their tolerance range. </p>
<h4 id="Resistor-Color-Code">Resistor Color Code</h4>
<p>There are mainly four color bands provided on the body of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s and each color indicates unique digit. Such as <span style="background-color:black;color:white;">Black</span> &rArr; 0, <span style="background-color:brown;color:white;">Brown</span> &rArr; 1, <span style="background-color:red;color:white;">Red</span> &rArr; 2, <span style="background-color:orange;color:white;">Orange</span> &rArr; 3, <span style="background-color:yellow;">Yellow</span> &rArr; 4, <span style="background-color:green;color:white;">Green</span> &rArr; 5, <span style="background-color:blue;color:white;">Blue</span> &rArr; 6, <span style="background-color:violet;color:white;">Violet</span> &rArr; 7 <span style="background-color:gray;">Gray</span> &rArr; 8, <span style="border:1px solid #000;">White</span> &rArr; 9. The first and second color bands indicate a two digits number. The 3rd color band indicates the power of ten as multiplier. The fourth band indicates the tolerance.<br />
<div id="attachment_312" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 550px"><a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/carbon-composition-resistor/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-312"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/carbon-composition-resistor.jpg" alt="Carbon Composition Resistor" width="540" height="338" class="size-full wp-image-312" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Carbon Composition Resistor</p></div><br />
If fourth band is of golden color the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s may have &plusmn; 5 % tolerance in its value, if fourth band is of silver color, the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> must have &plusmn; 10 % tolerance and if there is no fourth band provided, then the carbon <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> may have &plusmn; 20 % tolerance in it's value. </p>
<p>Suppose we have a carbon composition <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> which has four color bands among which first band is blue second band is yellow, third band is red and fourth band is golden. So from the above rule the first digit of the number will be 6 ( as <span style="background-color:blue;color:white;">Blue</span> &rArr; 6 ), the second digit of the number will be 4 ( as <span style="background-color:yellow;">Yellow</span> &rArr; 4 ) and the multiplier of this two digit number will be 10<sup>2</sup> ( as <span style="background-color:red;color:white;">Red</span> &rArr; 2 ). Hence <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> value of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> will be 64 X 10<sup>2</sup> &Omega;. The tolerance of that value may be &plusmn; 5 % as the color of fourth band is golden.</p>

<h3 id="Wire-Wound-Resistor">Wire Wound Resistor</h3>
<p>The construction of this type of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is also very simple. In <strong>wire wound <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong> a wire of manganin or constantan is wound around a cylinder of insulated material. The <a href="../temperature-coefficient-of-resistance/index.html" >temperature coefficient of resistance</a> of these two materials is almost zero. So there would no <a href="../resistance-variation-with-temperature/index.html" >resistance variation with temperature</a>. The wounded wire is covered with an insulating material such as baked enamel. This cover of insulating heat resistible material is provided to resist the effect of ambient temperature variation. Different sizes and ratings of <strong>wire wound <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong> can easily be achieved by using different lengths and diameters of the wire. These <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are easily available for wide range of ratings. The range of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> values varies from 1 &Omega; to 1 M&Omega;. Typical tolerance limit of these <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s varies from 0.01 % to 1 %. They can be used for high power applications of 5 to 200 W dissipation ratings. The cost of these <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s is much higher than carbon <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. Normally wire wound <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is used where carbon composition <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> cannot meet the purpose because of its limitations.<br />

<p>The main disadvantage of this <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> that arises because of its coil like structure. At high frequency the behavior of the circuit may be changed due to its reaction. This problem can be solved if one half of the wire is wound in one direction and other half in opposite direction so that the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a> due to these two halves cancel each other hence net inductive effect of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> becomes nil. The non - inductive wire wound <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is ideal for high frequency circuit but it is costlier than an ordinary one.</p>

<p>Basic structure of this type of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is constructed by means of film deposition technique of deposition a thick film of resistible material such as pure carbon or metal on to an insulating core. The desired value of resistance of <strong>metal film <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong> or <strong>carbon film <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a></strong> can easily be obtained by either trimming the layer of thickness or by cutting helical grooves of suitable pitch along its length. That means for different resistance values, the length and depth of the helical grooves is maintained accordingly.<br />

<p>Metallic contact cap is fitted at both ends of the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. The caps must be in contact with resistible film or helical grooves. The lead wires are welded to these end caps. <strong>Metal Film Resistor</strong> or <strong>Carbon Film Resistor</strong> can be made up to a value of 10,000 M&Omega; and size of this type of <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> is much smaller than wire wound <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>. Because of their constructional features these <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> are fully non - inductive. The accuracy level of metal film <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> can be of order &plusmn; 1 % and they are suitable for high grade applications.</p>
<p>Carbon film <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> givers lower tolerances and smaller values of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> than those available with metal film. However the carbon film posses a mildly negative <a href="../temperature-coefficient-of-resistance/index.html" >temperature coefficient of resistance</a> which is very useful for certain electronic circuit. </p>
