<p>For lightning and general purposes in homes, offices, shops, small factories single phase system is widely used as compared to <a href="../three-phase-circuit-star-and-delta-system/index.html" >three phase system</a> as the single phase system is more economical and the power requirement in most of the houses, shops, offices are small, which can be easily met by single phase system. The single phase motors are simple in construction, cheap in cost, reliable and easy to repair and maintain. Due to all these advantages the single phase motor finds its application in vacuum cleaner, fans, washing machine, centrifugal pump, blowers, washing machine, small toys etc.</p>
<p>The single phase ac motors are further classified as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Single phase induction motors</strong> or <strong>asynchronous motors</strong>.</li>
<li>Single phase synchronous motors.</li>
<li>Commutator motors.</li>
</ol>
<p> This article will provide fundamentals, description and <strong>working principle of single phase induction motor</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Construction-of-Single-Phase-Induction-Motor">Construction of Single Phase Induction Motor</h2>
<p>Like any other electrical motor <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">asynchronous motor</a> also have two main parts namely rotor and stator.</p>
<p>Stator: As its name indicates stator is a stationary part of induction motor. A single phase ac supply is given to the stator of single phase induction motor.</p>
<p>Rotor: The rotor is a rotating part of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" >induction motor</a>. The rotor is connected to the mechanical load through the shaft. The rotor in single phase <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is of squirrel cage rotor type.</p>
<p>The <strong>construction of single phase induction motor</strong> is almost similar to the squirrel cage three phase motor except that in case of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">asynchronous motor</a> the stator have two windings instead of one as compare to the single stator winding in <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >three phase induction motor</a>.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="Stator-of-Single-Phase-Induction-Motor">Stator of Single Phase Induction Motor</h3>
<p>The stator of the single phase <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> has laminated stamping to reduce <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  losses on its periphery. The slots are provided on its stamping to carry stator or main winding. In order to reduce the hysteresis losses, stamping are made up of silicon steel. When the stator winding is given a single phase ac supply, the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> is produced and the motor rotates at a speed slightly less than the synchronous speed N<sub>s</sub> which is given by<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spim-12-06-14-01.gif" alt=""></center><br />
The construction of the stator of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">asynchronous motor</a> is similar to that of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> except there are two dissimilarity in the winding part of the single phase induction motor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly the single phase induction motors are mostly provided with concentric coils. As the number of turns per coil can be easily adjusted with the help of concentric coils, the mmf distribution is almost sinusoidal.</li>
<li>Except for shaded pole motor, the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">asynchronous motor</a> has two stator windings namely the main winding and the auxiliary winding. These two windings are placed in space quadrature with respect to each other.</li>
<h3 id="Rotor-of-Single-Phase-Induction-Motor">Rotor of Single Phase Induction Motor</h3>
<p> The construction of the rotor of the single phase <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is similar to the squirrel cage <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >three phase induction motor</a>. The rotor is cylindrical in shape and has slots all over its periphery. The slots are not made parallel to each other but are bit skewed as the skewing prevents magnetic locking of stator and rotor teeth and makes the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" >working of induction motor</a> more smooth and quieter. The squirrel cage rotor consists of aluminium, brass or copper bars. These aluminium or copper bars are called rotor conductors and are placed in the slots on the periphery of the rotor. The rotor conductors are permanently shorted by the copper or aluminium rings called the end rings. In order to provide mechanical strength these rotor conductor are braced to the end ring and hence form a complete closed circuit resembling like a cage and hence got its name as "squirrel cage induction motor". As the bars are permanently shorted by end rings, the rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> is very small and it is not possible to add external <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> as the bars are permanently shorted. The absence of slip ring and brushes make the construction of single phase <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> very simple and robust.</p>
<h2 id="Working-Principle-of-Single-Phase-Induction-Motor">Working Principle of Single Phase Induction Motor</h2>
<p><span class="Green">NOTE: We know that for the working of any electrical motor whether its ac or dc motor, we require two fluxes as, the interact of these two fluxes produced the required torque, which is desired parameter for any motor to rotate.</span></p>
<p>When single phase ac supply is given to the stator winding of single phase induction motor, the alternating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  starts flowing through the stator or main winding. This alternating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  produces an alternating flux called main flux. This main flux also links with the rotor conductors and hence cut the rotor conductors. According to the <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html" >Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction</a>, emf gets induced in the rotor. As the rotor circuit is closed one so, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  starts flowing in the rotor. This  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is called the rotor current. This rotor  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  produces its own flux called rotor flux. Since this flux is produced due to induction principle so, the motor working on this principle got its name as <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" >induction motor</a>. Now there are two fluxes one is main flux and another is called rotor flux. These two fluxes produce the desired torque which is required by the motor to rotate.</p>
<h3 id="Why-Single-Phase-Induction-Motor-is-not-Self-Starting?">Why Single Phase Induction Motor is not Self Starting?</h3>
<p>According to double field revolving theory, any alternating quantity can be resolved into two components, each component have magnitude equal to the half of the maximum magnitude of the alternating quantity and both these component rotates in opposite direction to each other. For example - a flux, &phi; can be resolved into two components<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spim-12-06-14-02.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Each of these components rotates in opposite direction i. e if one &phi;<sub>m</sub> / 2 is rotating in clockwise direction then the other &phi;<sub>m</sub> / 2 rotates in anticlockwise direction.</p>
<p>When a single phase ac supply is given to the stator winding of single phase induction motor, it produces its flux of magnitude, &phi;<sub>m</sub>. According to the double field revolving theory, this alternating flux, &phi;<sub>m</sub> is divided into two components of magnitude &phi;<sub>m</sub> /2. Each of these components will rotate in opposite direction, with the synchronous speed, N<sub>s</sub>. Let us call these two components of flux as forward component of flux, &phi;<sub>f</sub> and backward component of flux, &phi;<sub>b</sub>. The resultant of these two component of flux at any instant of time, gives the value of instantaneous stator flux at that particular instant.<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spim-12-06-14-03.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now at starting, both the forward and backward components of flux are exactly opposite to each other. Also both of these components of flux are equal in magnitude. So, they cancel each other and hence the net torque experienced by the rotor at starting is zero. So, the single phase induction motors are not self starting motors.</p>
<h4 id="Methods-for-Making-Single-Phase-Induction-as-Self-Starting-Motor">Methods for Making Single Phase Induction as Self Starting Motor</h4>
<p>From the above topic we can easily conclude that the single phase induction motors are not self starting because the produced stator flux is alternating in nature and at the starting the two components of this flux cancel each other and hence there is no net torque. The solution to this problem is that if the stator flux is made rotating type, rather than alternating type, which rotates in one particular direction only. Then the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" >induction motor</a> will become self starting. Now for producing this rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> we require two alternating flux, having some phase difference angle between them. When these two fluxes interact with each other they will produce a resultant flux. This resultant flux is rotating in nature and rotates in space in one particular direction only. Once the motor starts running, the additional flux can be removed. The motor will continue to run under the influence of the main flux only. Depending upon the methods for making <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">asynchronous motor</a> as Self Starting Motor, there are mainly four types of single phase <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> namely,</p>
<ol>
<li>Split phase induction motor,</li>
<li>Capacitor start <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  motor,</li>
<li>Capacitor start <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> run induction motor,</li>
<li>Shaded pole induction motor.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Comparison-between-Single-Phase-and-Three-Phase-Induction-Motors">Comparison between Single Phase and Three Phase Induction Motors</h3>
<ol>
<li>Single phase induction motors are simple in construction, reliable and economical for small power rating as compared to <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >three phase induction motors</a>.</li>
