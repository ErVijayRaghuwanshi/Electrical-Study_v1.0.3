</div>
<p>Before discussing about the <strong>induction motor drives</strong> we have to understand and know about induction motors. In very simple words induction motors can be described as a three phase, self starting constant speed ac motors. The reason of describing induction motors as constant speed is because normally these motors have a constant speed depending on the frequency of the supply and the no of windings. In the past it was not possible to control the speed of the induction motors according to the need. That’s why their use was limited and despite having many a motors they advantages over dc motors they could not be used because of this disadvantage. But at the field of drivers have improved due to the availability of <a href="../silicon-controlled-rectifier-scr-two-transistor-model-operating-principle/index.html" title="What is <a href="../thyristor-silicon-controlled-rectifier/index.html" title="Thyristor">thyristor</a> or SCR?">thyristor</a>s, power transistors, IGBTs and GTOs the variable speed <strong>induction motor drives</strong> have been invented. Though the cost of these drivers are more than dc driver, but still the use of induction motors are increasing and they are replacing dc motors because of their advantages. While discussing about this topic we will look through the starting, braking and speed control of induction motors.</p>
<h2 id="Starting-of-Induction-Motors"> Starting of Induction Motors</h2>
<p><P> We know that the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is self starting  i.e when the supply is given to the motor it starts to rotate without any external help. When an <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is started as there is no <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> initially (i.e, during starting), there is a tendency of huge  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow through the rotor circuit which may damage the circuit permanently. To overcome this problem various methods have been introduced to limit the starting current. Some of the methods are <br/><br />
1) Star delta starter <br/><br />
2) Auto- transformers starter<br/><br />
3) Reactor starter<br/><br />
4) Saturable reactor starter<br/><br />
5) Part winding starter<br/><br />
6) ac <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> controller starter<br/><br />
7) Rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> starter is used for starting of wound rotor motor.<br />
The <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> drives are normally designed to run on delta connection, but during starting the supply is given from star connection because then the starter <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  reduces by 1/√3 times than the delta connection. When the motor reaches a steady state speed the connection changes from star to delta connection.<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/star-delta-starting.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/star-delta-starting.gif" alt="star delta srtarting" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3942" /></a><br />
Another type of starting method of induction motors is the Auto transformer starting. Since we know that the torque is proportional to square of the voltage. By auto transformers the starting <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  are reduced to overcome the problem of overheating due to very high  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow. During starting the ratio of the transformer is set in a way that the starting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  does not exceed the safe limit. Once the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> starts running and reaches a steady state value, the autotransformer is disconnected from the supply. The circuit diagram is given here with<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/auto-transformer-starter.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/auto-transformer-starter.gif" alt="auto transformer starter" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3944" /></a><br />
Another method of starting is softstart using saturable reactor drivers. In this method high reactance is introduced into the circuit so that the starting torque is closed to zero. Now the reactance is reduced smoothly during starting and the starting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  increases and the torque also varies steplessly. In this method the motor starts without any jerk and the acceleration is smooth, that’s why its called soft start also.<br />
<div id="attachment_3947" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 216px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/reactor-starting.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/reactor-starting.gif" alt="reactor starting" width="206" height="250" class="size-full wp-image-3947" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Reactor Starting of Induction Motor</p></div><br />
Unbalanced starting scheme for soft start is another type of starting method where the impedance is introduced only in one of the supply phases. During starting the impedance is kept very high so that the motor operates as a single phase motor, the speed torque characteristics at that time is similar to curve A in the graph. When the speed attains a steady state value the impedance is removed completely, at that time the curve is similar to B, which is the natural characteristics of the matine. This starting method is also without any jerk and the operation is very smooth.<br />
<div id="attachment_3948" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 360px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/starting-method-induction-m.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/starting-method-induction-m.gif" alt="Variable Impedance Starting of Induction Motor" width="350" height="259" class="size-full wp-image-3948" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Variable Impedance Starting of Induction Motor</p></div><br />
Part winding starting method is special for squirrel-cage induction motors. In this method two or more starter winding are connected in parallel. When the motor starts, any one of the winding is connected as a result the starter impendence is increased and starting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is reduced. When the steady speed is acquired by the motor both the windings are connected.<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/part-winding-starting.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/part-winding-starting.gif" alt="part winding starter" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3949" /></a><br />
Specially for wound rotor motors. Rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> starter is used. In this method external <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s are used in the rotor circuit to limit the starting current. Maximum value of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is chosen to limit the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  at zero speed within the safe value. As the speed increases, the sectional <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is the temperature rise is lower than other methods of starting high acceleration, frequent starts and stops starting with heavy loads can be done with this type of starting method.<br />

<h3 id="Braking-of-Induction-Motors">Braking of Induction Motors</h3>
<p>When it comes to controlling an electric machine by electric drivers braking is a very important term because it helps to decrease the speed of the motor according to will and necessity.(strong) braking of induction motors (/strong) can be classified mainly in three types<br/><br />
1) Regenerative braking<br/><br />
2) plugging or reverse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> braking<br/><br />
3) Dynamic braking which can be further classified as<br/><br />
a) ac dynamic braking<br/><br />
b) self-excited braking using capacitors<br/><br />
c) dc dynamic braking<br/><br />
d) zero sequence braking<br />
To explain that regeneration braking for induction motor, we can take help of the equation <br/><br />
 P<sub>in</sub> = 3 N I<sub>s</sub> Cos&#038;theta<sub>s</sub><br/><br />
here &#038;theta<sub>s</sub> is the phase angle between the stator <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and stator current, the simple words whenever this phase angle exceeds 90&deg; (i.e &#038;theta<sub>s</sub>>90&deg;) regenerative braking can take place. To explain this more clearly and easily we can say that whenever the speed of the rotor exceeds synchronous speed, regeneration braking occurs. That is because whenever the rotor rotates at a speed more than synchronous speed there is a reverse field occurs which opposes the normal rotation of the motor and therefore braking takes place. Main disadvantage of this type of braking is that the speed of the motor has to exceed synchronous speed which may not be possible every time. To acquire regenerative braking at a lower speed than synchronous speed, variable frequency source can be used.<br />
<div id="attachment_3529" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/regenerative-braking.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/regenerative-braking.gif" alt="regenerative braking" width="400" height="332" class="size-full wp-image-3529" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Regenerative Braking</p></div><br />
Plugging of induction motors is done by interchanging any two of the supply terminals. When the terminals are reversed the operation of the machine changes from motoring to plugging. From technical point of view and for better understanding it can be said that the slip changes from ‘s’ to (2-s), which indicates that due to reversal of the terminals the torque also changes its direction and braking occurs<br />
<div id="attachment_3531" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 710px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-braking.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-braking.gif" alt="induction motor braking" width="700" height="472" class="size-full wp-image-3531" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Induction Motor Braking</p></div><br />
The first classification of dynamic braking of induction motors is ac dynamic braking any one of the supply phase is disconnected from the supply and then it is either kept open or connected with the other phase. The first type is known as two lead connection and the second one is known as three lead connection. To understand this braking method clearly we can assume the system to be a single phase system. Now the motor can be considered to be fed by positive and negative sequence voltages. That’s why when the rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is high the net torque is negative and braking can be acquired.<br />
<div id="attachment_3534" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 710px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-drive-1.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-drive-1.gif" alt="Induction Motor Drive" width="700" height="410" class="size-full wp-image-3534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Induction Motor Drive</p></div><br />
Sometimes  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> are kept permanent by connected across the supply terminals of the motor. This is called self-excited braking using  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> of induction motors. This type of braking works mainly by the property of the  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> to store energy. Whenever the motor is disconnected from the supply the motor starts to work as a self-excited induction generator, the power comes from the  <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitors</a> connected across the terminals. The values of the <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> are so chosen that they are sufficient to make the motor work as an induction generator after being disconnected from the supply. When the motor works as an induction generator the produced torque opposes the normal rotation of the motor and hence braking takes place.<br />
<div id="attachment_3535" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 710px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-drive-2.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/induction-motor-drive-2.gif" alt="Self excited braking of induction motor" width="700" height="314" class="size-full wp-image-3535" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Self excited braking of induction motor</p></div><br />
Another type of dynamic braking is dc dynamic braking. In this method the stator of running <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> drives is connected to dc supply. The consequences of connecting a dc supply to the stator is as follow, the dc  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  produces a stationary <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>, in the rotor keeps rotating and as a result there is a induced <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in the rotor winding, therefore the machine works as a generator which opposes the motion of the motor and braking is acquired<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dynamic-braking-operation.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dynamic-braking-operation.gif" alt="dynamic braking operation" width="400" height="283" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3539" /></a></p>
<h3 id="Speed-Control-of-Induction-Motors">Speed Control of Induction Motors</h3>
<p>We have discussed about the starting and braking of induction motors but what about controlling the speed during the running time.(strong) speed control of induction motors(strong) can be done in six methods which are <br/><br />
i) Pole changing<br/><br />
ii) Stator <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> control<br/><br />
iii) Supply frequency control<br/><br />
iv) Eddy –current coupling<br/><br />
v) Rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> control<br/><br />
vi) Slip power recovery<br />
We know that the speed of the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is inversely proportional to number of poles. So it is possible to increase or decrease the speed of the <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> if the number of the poles are decreased or increased respectively. The motor in which the provision of changing the number of poles is present, they are called ‘pole changing motor’ or ‘multi –speed motor’.<br />
Another method of controlling the speed of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> drives is the stator <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> control. Stator <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is directly responsible for the rotating speed of the rotor. Torque is proportional to <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> squared and the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is proportional to the voltage. So, if the stator <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is reduced the speed reduces and similarly if the stator <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is increased the speed also increases.<br />
<div id="attachment_3951" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 360px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/starter-voltage-control.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/starter-voltage-control.gif" alt="starter <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference"><p class="wp-caption-text">voltage</a> control" width="350" height="294" class="size-full wp-image-3951" /></a> Starter Voltage Control</p></div><br />
The speed of an <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is proportional to the product of the supply frequency and air gap flux. But as there is a chance of magnetic saturation while decreasing the supply frequency, that’s why not only the frequency but the v/f ( i. e the ratio of supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and frequency ) is controlled and this ratio is tried to be kept constant. And if the speed is needed to be changed the ratio of v/f is changed accordingly.<br />
<div id="attachment_3952" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/variable-frequency-control.gif"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/variable-frequency-control.gif" alt="variable frequency control of induction motor" width="600" height="264" class="size-full wp-image-3952" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Variable Frequency Control of Induction Motor</p></div><br />
The <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  speed control method is done by placing an <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  clutch between an <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is running at a fixed speed and the variable speed load. Now what is this <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  clutch? It is nothing but an <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> drives in which both stator and the rotor are allowed to rotate. The rotor is coupled with the main induction motor. When eddy currents are produced in the rotor drum, their interaction with the stator field and a torque is produced which rotates the main motor. By controlling the dc  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the stator winding the speed of the motor can be controlled.<br />
Depending on the rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, the speed of the rotor falls or increases. The variation of speed torque characteristics with respect to change in rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is shown in the figures below. This speed controlling method is better than many other methods because of low cost.<br />
