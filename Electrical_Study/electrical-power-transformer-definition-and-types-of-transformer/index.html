<h2 id="Definition-of-Transformer">Definition of Transformer</h2>
<p>A transformer is a static machine used for transforming power from one circuit to another without changing frequency. This is a very basic <strong>definition of transformer</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="History-of-Transformer">History of Transformer</h2>
<p>The <strong>history of transformer</strong> was commenced in the year 1880. In the year 1950, 400KV <strong>electrical power transformer</strong> was introduced in high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system. In the early 1970s, unit rating as large as 1100MVA was produced and 800KV and even higher KV class transformers were manufactured in year of 1980.</p>
<h2 id="Use-of-Power-Transformer">Use of Power Transformer</h2>
<p> <a href="../electric-power-generation/index.html" title="Electric Power Generation">Generation of electrical power</a> in low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level is very much cost effective. Hence <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> is generated in low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level. Theoretically, this low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level power can be transmitted to the receiving end. But if the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level of a power is increased, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> of the power is reduced which causes reduction in ohmic or I<sup>2</sup>R losses in the system, reduction in cross sectional area of the conductor i.e. reduction in capital cost of the system and it also improves the <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> of the system. Because of these, low level power must be stepped up for efficient <a href="../electrical-power-transmission-system-and-network/index.html" >electrical power transmission</a>. This is done by step up transformer at the sending side of the power system network. As this high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> power may not be distributed to the consumers directly, this must be stepped down to the desired level at the receiving end with the help of step down transformer. These are the uses of <strong>electrical power transformer</strong> in the <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system.<br />
<img src="../images/power-system-001.jpg" alt="power transformer" class="alignright" title="Electrical Power Transformer" /></p>
</p>
<p>Two winding transformers are generally used where ratio between high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is greater than 2. It is cost effective to use <a href="../what-is-auto-transformer/index.html" >auto transformer</a> where the ratio between high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is less than 2. Again three phase single unit transformer is more cost effective than a <a href="../single-three-phase-transformer-vs-bank-of-three-single-phase-transformers/index.html" >bank of three single phase transformer</a> unit in a <a href="../three-phase-circuit-star-and-delta-system/index.html" title="Three Phase Star and Delta System">three phase system</a>. But still it is preferable to use than the later where power dealing is very large since such large size of three phase single unit <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" title="Electrical Power Transformer">power transformer</a> may not be easily transported from manufacturer's place to work site.</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Transformer">Types of Transformer</h2>
<p>Transformers can be categorized in different ways, depending upon their purpose, use, construction etc. The <strong>types of transformer</strong> are as follows,</p>
<ol>
<li> <span class="Green">Step Up Transformer &amp; Step Down Transformer</span> - Generally used for stepping up and down the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level of power in transmission and distribution power network.</li>
<li> <span class="Green">Three Phase Transformer &amp; Single Phase Transformer</span> - Former is generally used in three phase power system as it is cost effective than later but when size matters, it is preferable to use bank of three single phase transformer as it is easier to transport three single phase unit separately than one single three phase unit.</li>
<p><img src="../images/transformer001.jpg" alt="electrical power transformer" title="Electrical Power Transformer" class="alignleft"/></p>
<li> <span class="Green"> Electrical Power Transformer, Distribution Transformer &amp; Instrument Transformer </span>- Transformer is generally used in transmission network which is normally known as <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" title="Electrical Power Transformer">power transformer</a>, distribution transformer is used in distribution network and this is lower rating transformer and <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a> &amp; <a href="../voltage-transformer-or-potential-transformer-theory/index.html" >potential transformer</a>, we use for relay and protection purpose in <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system and in different instruments in industries are called instrument transformer.</li>
<li> <span class="Green"> Two Winding Transformer &amp; <a href="../what-is-auto-transformer/index.html" >Auto Transformer</a></span> - Former is generally used where ratio between high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is greater than 2. It is cost effective to use later where the ratio between high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is less than 2.</li>
<li> <span class="Green"> Outdoor Transformer &amp; Indoor Transformer</span> - Transformers that are designed for installing at outdoor are outdoor transformers and transformers designed for installing at indoor are indoor transformers.</li>
