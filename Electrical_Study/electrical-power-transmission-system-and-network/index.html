<h2 id="Electrical-Power-Transmission-System">Electrical Power Transmission System</h2>
<p>Electrical power is generated at different generating stations. These generating stations are not necessarily situated at the load center. During construction of generating station number of factors to be considered from economical point of view. These all factors may not be easily available at load center, hence generating stations are not normally  situated very nearer to load center. Load center is the place where maximum power is consumed. Hence there must be some means by which the generated power must be transmitted to the load center. <strong>Electrical transmission system</strong> is the means of transmitting power from generating station to different load centers.</p>
<h3 id="Factor-to-be-Considered-for-Constructing-a-Generating-Station">Factor to be Considered for Constructing a Generating Station</h3>
<p>During planning of construction of generating station the following factors to be considered for <a href="../economics-of-power-generation/index.html">economical generation of electrical power</a>.</p>
<p>1) Easy availability of water for <a href="../thermal-power-generation-plant-or-thermal-power-station/index.html" >thermal power generating station</a>.</p>
<p>2) Easy availability of land for construction of power station including it's staff township.</p>
<p>3) For hydro power station there must be a dam on river. So proper place on the river must be chosen in such a way that the construction of the dam can be done in most optimum way.</p>
<p>4) For <a href="../thermal-power-generation-plant-or-thermal-power-station/index.html">thermal power station</a> easy availability of fuel is one of the most important factors to be considered.</p>
<p>5) Better communication for goods as well as employees of the power station also to be kept into consideration.</p>
<p>6) For transporting very  big spare parts of turbines, <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html" >alternators</a> etc, there must be wide road ways, rain communication, and deep and wide river must pass away nearby the power station.</p>
<p>7) For nuclear power plant, it must be situated in such a distance from common location so that there may be any effect from nuclear reaction the heath of common people.</p>
<p>Many other factors also to be considered, but there are beyond the scope of our discussion.</p>
<p>All the factors listed above are very difficult to be available at load center. The power station or generating station must be situated where all the facilities are easily available. This place may not be necessarily at the load center. The power generated at generating station then transmitted to the load center by means of <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a>  transmission system as we said earlier.<br />
<img src="../images/tower002.jpg" alt="Electrical Power Transmission System Engineering" title="Electrical Power Transmission System Engineering" class="alignright"/><br />
The power generated at generating station is in low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level as low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> power generation has some economical values. Low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> power generation is more economical than high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> power generation. At low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level, bot weight and wide of insulation is less in the <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html">alternator</a>, this directly reduces the cost and size of <a href="../alternator-or-synchronous-generator/index.html">alternator</a>. But this low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level power can not be transmitted directly to the consumer end as because this low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> power transmission is not at all economical. Hence although low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> power generation is economical but low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> transmission is not economical. Electrical power is directly proportional to the product of electrical  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html">voltage</a> of system. So for transmitting certain <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> from one place to another, if the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the power is increased then associated  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> of this power is reduced. Reduced  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  means less I<sup>2</sup>R loss in the system, less cross sectional area of the conductor means less capital involvement and decreased  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  causes improvement in <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> of power transmission system and improved <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> indicates quality power. Because of these three reasons <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> mainly transmitted at high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level.</p>
</p>
<p>Again at distribution end for efficient distribution of the transmitted power, it is stepped down to its desired low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level.</p>
<p>So it can be concluded that first the <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> is generated at low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level then it stepped up to high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> for efficient transmission of electrical energy. Lastly for distribution of electrical energy or power to different consumers it is stepped down to desired low <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level.</p>
<p>This brief discussion of <strong>electrical transmission system</strong> and network, but now we will discussed little bit more details about transmission of electrical energy.</p>
<h2 id="Transmission-of-Electrical-Energy">Transmission of Electrical Energy</h2>
<p>Fundamentally there are two systems by which electrical energy can be transmitted.</p>
<p>(1) High <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> DC electrical transmission system.</p>
<p>(2) High <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> AC electrical transmission system.</p>
<p>There are some advantages in using DC transmission system-</p>
<p>i) Only two conductor are required for Dc transmission system. It is further possible to use only one conductor of DC transmission system if earth is utilized as return path of the system.</p>
<p>ii) The potential stress on the insulator of DC transmission system is about 70% of same <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> AC transmission system. Hence less insulation cost is involved in DC transmission system.</p>
<p>iii) Inductance, capacitance, phase displacement and surge problems can be eliminated in DC system.</p>
<p>Even having these advantages in DC system, generally electrical energy is transmitted by three(3) phase AC transmission system.</p>
<p>i)The alternating voltages can easily be stepped up &#038; down, which is not possible in DC transmission system.</p>
<p>ii) Maintenance of AC substation is quite easy and economical compared to DC syte.</p>
<p>iii) The transforming in AC <a href="../electrical-power-substation-engineering-and-layout/index.html">electrical sub station</a> is much easier than <a href="../motor-generator-set-m-g-set/index.html">motor-generator sets</a> in DC system.</p>
<p>But AC transmission system also have some disadvantages like,</p>
<p>i) The volume of conductor used in AC system is much higher than that of DC.</p>
<p>ii)The reactance of the line, affects the <a href="../voltage-regulation-of-transformer/index.html" title="Voltage Regulation of Transformer ">voltage regulation</a> of <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> transmission system.</p>
<p>iii) Problems of <a href="../skin-effect-in-transmission-lines/index.html">skin effects</a> and proximity effects only found in AC system.</p>
<p>iv) AC transmission system is more likely to be affected by <a href="../corona-effect-in-power-system/index.html" >corona effect</a> than DC system.</p>
<p>v) Construction of AC <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> transmission network is more completed than DC system.</p>
<p>vi) Proper synchronizing is required before inter connecting two or more transmission lines together, synchronizing can totally be omitted in DC transmission system.</p>
