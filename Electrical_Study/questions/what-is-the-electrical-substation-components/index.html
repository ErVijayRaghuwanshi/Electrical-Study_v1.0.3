			<p>Substation is considered as the power corridor for any type of power transmission and distribution network. The components of a substation entirely depend up on the nature of service, types of operation and level of safety associated with the power system network. The general and commonly used components of a substation are elaborated as follows.</p><center><!-- Putu-1 -->
</p>
<p><b>Power Transformer:-</b> </p>
<p>Modern substations use the 3 phase transformer in practice, because their operation and handling is quite easy and cost effective. Transformers are used to change the voltage level. Suppose a substation is located near the load center, so the prime objective will be to transform the voltage level into low state, which will be distributed over consumer circle. Substations which are installed near the generating plants, the objective should be to step up the voltage level for long transmission. In distribution substations, oil immersed forced cooling transformers are used commonly, which are rated in MVA. </p>
<p><b>Bus bar:-</b></p>
<p>Bus bars are made up with copper or aluminium pipes which may be hollow circular or triangular and they operates at constant voltage. Several incoming lines and connected with it as well several outgoing feeders are also tapped from the bus bar. Most common bus bar configurations are single bus arrangement, single bus with section, double bus arrangement. </p>
<p><b>Isolating Switches:-</b></p>
<p>They are installed with every substations in order to separate a particular portion of the system from the rest. There may be some maintenance or other needs, but isolating switches are opened off load condition. Because they only acts like a knife switch, but for on load operations a isolating switch must capable of arc quenching.</p>
<p><b>Circuit Breaker:-</b></p>
<p>Circuit breaker is a specially designed switch which can be operated under on load and even faulty condition. There are several types of circuit breaker, but most commonly used types are Oil circuit breaker, Vacuum circuit breaker and SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker. They also designed with automatic fault sensing mechanism with relay coil, which will sense a system fault and trips automatically. However they also operated manually. These devices are commonly used protecting device for power system and equipped with arc interrupting facility.</p>
<p><b>Instrument Transformers:-</b></p>
<p>Instrument transformers means current transformers and potential transformers, which are used to convert the current or voltage in safe low level. These quantities are then measured by common measuring instruments like ammeter or voltmeter. The assembly of instrument transformer and measuring devices are widely used in substations for metering purpose. Instrument transformers are also used for protection purpose, they continuously measures the line voltage and current and transmits the fault signal if predetermined safe limit is reached.  </p>
<p>These are the important components of the substations. Beside of these components earthing transformer, control panel units, metering instruments and fuses are also used.           </p>
