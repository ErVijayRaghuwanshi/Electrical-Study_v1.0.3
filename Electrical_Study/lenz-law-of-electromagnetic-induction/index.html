<p><strong>Lenz's law</strong> is named after the German scientist H. F. E. Lenz in 1834. <strong>Lenz's law</strong> obeys Newton's third law of motion (i.e to every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction) and the conservation of energy (i.e energy may neither be created nor destroyed and therefore the sum of all the energies in the system is a constant).</p>
<p>Lenz law is based on <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html"  >Faraday's law</a> of induction, so before understanding Lenz's law; one should know what is <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html"  >Faraday’s law of induction</a>? When a changing <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> is linked with a coil, an emf is induced in it. This change in <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> may be caused by changing the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> strength by moving a magnet towards or away from the coil, or moving the coil into or out of the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> as desired. Or in simple words, we can say that the magnitude of the emf induced in the circuit is proportional to the rate of change of flux.<br />

<h2 id="Lenz's-Law">Lenz's Law</h2>
<p>Lenz's law states that when an emf is generated by a change in <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> according to <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html"  >Faraday's Law</a>, the polarity of the induced emf is such, that it produces an  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> that's <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> opposes the change which produces it.</p>
</p>
<p>The negative sign used in <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html"  >Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction</a>, indicates that the induced emf ( &epsilon; ) and the change in <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> ( &delta;&Phi;<sub>B</sub> ) have opposite signs.<br />
<img src="../equations/llem-2.gif" alt=" "/> </p>
<p>Where<br />
 &epsilon; = Induced emf</p>
<p>&delta;&Phi;<sub>B</sub> = change in magnetic flux</p>
<p> N = No of turns in coil</p>
<h3 id="Reason-for-Opposing,-Cause-of-Induced-Current-in-Lenz's-Law?">Reason for Opposing, Cause of Induced Current in Lenz's Law? </h3>
<p>•	As stated above, Lenz's law obeys the law of conservation of energy and if the direction of the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> that creates the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> of the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in a conductor are in same direction, then these two <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>s would add up and produce the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of twice the magnitude and this would in turn create more <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>, which will cause more  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  and this process continuing on and on leads to violation of the law of conservation of energy.</p>
<p>•	If the induced  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  creates a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> which is equal and opposite to the direction of <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> that creates it, then only it can resist the change in the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> in the area, which is in accordance to the Newton's third law of motion.</p>
<h2 id="Explanation-of-Lenz's-Law">Explanation of Lenz's Law</h2>
<p>For understanding Lenz's law, consider two cases :<br />
CASE-I  When a magnet is moving towards the coil.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lenz-law-1.jpg"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lenz-law-1.jpg" alt="Lenz&#039;s law " width="431" height="141" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4583" /></a></p>
<p>When the north pole of the magnet is approaching towards the coil, the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> linking to the coil increases. According to <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html"  >Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction</a>, when there is change in flux, an emf and hence  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is induced in the coil and this  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will create its own <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> . Now according to Lenz's law, this <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> created will oppose its own or we can say opposes the increase in flux through the coil and this is possible only if approaching coil side attains north polarity, as we know similar poles repel each other. Once we know the magnetic polarity of the coil side, we can easily determine the direction of the induced  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  by applying right hand rule. In this case, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows in anticlockwise direction.</p>
<p>CASE-II  When a magnet is moving away from the coil<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lenz-law-2.jpg"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lenz-law-2.jpg" alt="Lenz&#039;s law " width="431" height="137" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4584" /></a></p>
<p>When the north pole of the magnet is moving away from the coil, the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> linking to the coil decreases. According to <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html"  >Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction</a>, an emf and hence  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is induced in the coil and this  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will create its own <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> . Now according to Lenz's law, this <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> created will oppose its own or we can say opposes the decrease in flux through the coil and this is possible only if approaching coil side attains south polarity, as we know dissimilar poles attract each other. Once we know the magnetic polarity of the coil side, we can easily determine the direction of the induced  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  by applying right hand rule. In this case, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows in clockwise direction.</p>
<p class="Green">NOTE : For finding the directions of <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> or electric current, use right hand thumb rule i.e if the fingers of the right hand are placed around the wire so that the thumb points in the direction of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flow, then the curling of fingers will show  the direction of the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> produced by the wire.<br />
<div id="attachment_4566" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 450px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/right-hand-rule.png"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/right-hand-rule.png" alt="Right hand thumb rule " width="440" height="346" class="size-full wp-image-4566" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Right hand thumb rule</p></div><br />
The Lenz law can be summarized as under: <br/></p>
<p>•	If the <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> Ф linking a coil increases, the direction of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the coil will be such that it will oppose the increase in flux and hence the induced  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will produce its flux in a direction as shown below (using right hand thumb rule).<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lenz-law-3.jpg"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lenz-law-3.jpg" alt="Lenz&#039;s law " width="210" height="99" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4567" /></a><br />
•	If <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> Ф linking a coil is decreasing, the flux produced by the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the coil is such, that it will aid the main flux and hence the direction of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is as shown below,<br />
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lenz-law-4.jpg"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lenz-law-4.jpg" alt="Lenz&#039;s law" width="144" height="101" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4569" /></a></p>
<h2 id="Application-of-Lenz's-Law">Application of Lenz's Law</h2>
<p>•	Lenz's law can be used to understand the concept of stored magnetic energy in an inductor. When a source of emf is connected across an inductor, a  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  starts flowing through it. The back emf will oppose this increase in  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through the inductor. In order to establish the flow of current, the external source of emf has to do some work to overcome this opposition. This work can be done by the emf is stored in the <a href="../what-is-inductor-and-inductance-theory-of-inductor/index.html" title="What is Inductor and Inductance?">inductor</a>  and it can be recovered after removing the external source of emf from the circuit</p>
<p>•      This law indicates that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs which provide a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in <a href="../faraday-law-of-electromagnetic-induction/index.html"  >Faraday's law of induction</a>.</p>
<p>•       Lenz's law is also applied to electric generators. When an  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> is induced in a generator, the direction of this induced  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is such that it opposes and causes rotation of generator (as in accordance to Lenz's law) and hence the generator requires more mechanical energy. It also provides back emf in case of <a href="../electrical-motor-types-classification-and-history-of-motor/index.html"  >electric motors</a>.</p>
<p>•       Lenz’s law is also used in electromagnetic braking and induction cook tops.</p>
