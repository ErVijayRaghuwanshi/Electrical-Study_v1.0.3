<h2 id="norton-theorem">Norton Theorem</h2>
<p>This theorem is just alternative of <a href="../thevenin-theorem-and-thevenin-equivalent-voltage-and-resistance/index.html">Thevenin theorem</a>. In <strong>Norton theorem</strong>, we just replace the circuit connected to a particular branch by equivalent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> . In this theorem, the circuit network is reduced into a single constant <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  in which, the equivalent internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is connected in parallel with it. Every <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html">voltage source</a> can be converted into equivalent <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> .</p>
<p>Suppose, in complex network we have to find out the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> through a particular branch. If the network has one of more active sources, then it will supply <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> through the said branch. As in the said branch  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  comes from the network, it can be considered that the network itself is a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a> . So in <strong>Norton theorem</strong> the network with different active sources is reduced to single <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  that's internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is nothing but the looking back <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, connected in parallel to the derived source. The looking back resistance of a network is the equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> of the network when someone looks back into the network from the terminals where said branch is connected. During calculating this equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, all sources are removed leaving their internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s in the network. Actually in Norton theorem, the branch of the network through which we have to find out the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a>, is removed from the network. After removing the branch, we short circuit the terminals where the said branch was connected. Then we calculate the short circuit <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> that flows between the terminals. This  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is nothing but Norton equivalent <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> I<sub>N</sub> of the source. The equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> between the said terminals with all sources removed leaving their internal resistances in the circuit is calculated and said it is R<sub>N</sub>. Now we will form a <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Current Source">current source</a>  that's  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is I<sub>N</sub> A and internal shunt <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is R<sub>N</sub> &Omega;.</p>
</p>
<p>For getting clearer concept of this theorem, we have explained it by the following example,</p>
<p>In the example two <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a>s R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are connected in series and this series combination is connected across one <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html">voltage source</a> of emf E with internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R<sub>i</sub> as shown. Series combination of one resistive branch of R<sub>L</sub> and another resistance R<sub>3</sub> is connected across the <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R<sub>2</sub> as shown. Now we have to find out the <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> through R<sub>L</sub> by applying Norton theorem.<br />
<center><img src="../images01/norton-theorem-01.gif" alt="norton theorem" title="Norton Theorem Circuit"/></center></p>
<p>First, we have to remove the <a href="../types-of-resistor-carbon-composition-and-wire-wound-resistor/index.html" title="Types of resistor">resistor</a> R<sub>L</sub> from terminals A and B and make the terminals A and B short circuited by zero resistance.</p>
<p>Second, we have to calculate the short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or Norton equivalent  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>N</sub> through the points A and B.</p>
<p><center><img src="../images01/norton-theorem-02.gif" alt="norton equivalent current" title="Norton Theorem Circuit"/></center></p>
<p><center><img src="../equations/norton.gif" alt=""/></center><br />
To determine internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> or Norton equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R<sub>N</sub> of the network under consideration, remove the branch between A and B and also replace the <a href="../ideal-dependent-independent-voltage-current-source/index.html" title="Voltage Source">voltage source</a>  by its internal resistance. Now the equivalent <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> as viewed from open terminals A and B is R<sub>N</sub>,</p>
<p><center><img src="../images01/norton-theorem-03.gif" alt="norton equivalent resistance" title="Norton Theorem Circuit"/></center><br />
<center><img src="../equations/norton2.gif" alt=""/></center></p>
<p>As per Norton theorem, when <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> R<sub>L</sub> is reconnected across terminals A and B, the network behaves as a source of constant <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">current</a> I<sub>N</sub> with shunt connected internal resistance R<sub>N</sub> and this is Norton equivalent circuit. </p>
