<p>Before understanding <strong>accuracy limit factor</strong> and <strong>instrument security factor of CT</strong> or  <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a> we  must try to understand different technical parameters of instrument transformer i.e. of <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a> and <a href="../voltage-transformer-or-potential-transformer-theory/index.html" >voltage transformer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Technical-Parameters-of-Instrument-Transformer">Technical Parameters of Instrument Transformer </h2>
<p>Following are some of the normally used terms associated with instrument transformer, that is, both for <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a> and <a href="../voltage-transformer-or-potential-transformer-theory/index.html" >voltage transformer</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Rated-Primary-Current-of-Current-Transformer">Rated Primary Current of Current Transformer</h3>
<p>This is the value of rated primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer on which the CT is designed to perform best. Hence rated primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer is an optimum value of primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  at which, error of the CT are minimum and losses in the CT are also less, that means in few words, performance of the CT is best; with optimum heating of the transformer.</p></p>
<h3 id="Rated-Secondary-Current-of-Current-Transformer">Rated Secondary Current of Current Transformer</h3>
<p>Like rated primary current, this is the value of secondary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  due to which errors in the CT are minimum. In other words, rated secondary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer is the value of secondary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  on which the best performance of the CT is based.</p>
<h3 id="Rated-Burden-of-Current-Transformer">Rated Burden of Current Transformer</h3>
<p>Whatever is connected externally with the secondary of a  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer is called <strong>burden of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer</strong>. In <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a> the secondary is connected with load, but in case of <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a>, electrical consumer load is not connected to the secondary. In <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a> we loaded the secondary of the transformer by connecting consumer's one by one to the secondary side. But in case of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer or other instrument transformer, we connect, metering instrument and protection relays to the secondary, which obviously behave like load of the instrument transformer but do not have any direct relation with the load of the <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system. That is why, all the instruments, wires etc connected with the secondary of the instrument transformer or IT is called burden rather load. In this way, we distinguish the secondary circuit of a <a href="../current-transformer-ct-class-ratio-error-phase-angle-error-in-current-transformer/index.html" >current transformer</a> or <a href="../voltage-transformer-or-potential-transformer-theory/index.html" >voltage transformer</a> from other purpose <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" title="Electrical Transformer">electrical transformer</a>.Although literally, load and burden carry nearly same meaning in english language. Rated <strong>burden of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer</strong> is the value of the burden to be connected with the secondary of CT including connecting load <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> expressed in VA or ohms on which accuracy requirement is based. Similarly rated <strong>burden of <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transformer</strong> is the value of the burden to be connected with the secondary of Voltage Transformer including connecting load <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> expressed in VA or ohms on which accuracy requirement is based.</p>
<h3 id="Rated-Frequency-of-Current-Transformer">Rated Frequency of Current Transformer</h3>
<p>The value of the system frequency on which the <strong>instrument transformer</strong> operates.</p>
<h2 id="Accuracy-Class-of-Current-Transformer">Accuracy Class of Current Transformer </h2>
<p>There is always some difference in expected value and actual value of output of an instrument transformer  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  error and phase angle error count in CT, as because primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer has to contribute the excitation component of CT core. <strong>Accuracy class of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer</strong> is the highest permissible percentage composite error at rated current. The standard accuracy classes of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer as per IS-2705 are 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3 &amp; 5 for metering CT.</p>
<p>The accuracy class or simply class of measuring  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer is 0.1, means the maximum permissible limit of error is 0.1%, more clearly, if we try to measure 100 A with a 0.1 class CT, the measured value may be either 100.1 or 99.9 A or anything in between these range.</p>
<p>The standard accuracy class for the protection  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer, as per IS-2705 are 5 P, 10 P, 15 P. </p>
<p>Here in the protection  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer, 5 P means 5%, 10 P means 10%, and 15 P means 15% error and &prime;P&prime;  stands for protection.</p>

<h3 id="Rated-Short-Circuit-Current-of-a-Current-Transformer">Rated Short Circuit Current of a Current Transformer</h3>
<p>In some abnormal condition like huge short circuit fault, the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer faces a huge electric current, flows through the CT primary. Although this fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will not continue for long lime as because every fault in the system is cleared by electrical protection system within very short time. So  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer should be designed in such a way that it can withstand this huge fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  at least for certain amount of time. It is unnecessary to design any equipment for withstanding short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  for long period of time since the short circuit fault is cleared by protection switch gear within fraction of second. For CT rated short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer  is defined as the rms value of primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  which the CT will withstand for a rated time with its secondary winding short circuited without suffering harmful effects.</p>
<h3 id="Rated-Voltage-for-Current-Transformer(CT)">Rated Voltage for Current Transformer(CT)</h3>
<p>The RMS value of the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> used to designate the CT for a particular highest system <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is rated Voltage for  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system is increased if load of the system is reduced. As per standard, the system <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> can be raised up to 10% above the normal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> during no load condition. So every electrical equipment is such designed so that it can withstand this highest voltage. As  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer is an electrical equipment, it should also be designed to withstand highest system voltage.</p>
<h2 id="Instrument-Security-Factor">Instrument Security Factor</h2>
<p>ISF or <strong>instrument security factor</strong> of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer is defined as the ratio of instrument limit primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to the rated primary current. The instrument limit primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of metering CT is the value primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  beyond which CT core becomes saturated.</p>
<h2 id="Accuracy-Limit-Factor">Accuracy Limit Factor</h2>
<p>For protection  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer, the ratio of accuracy limit primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to the rated primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is called <strong>accuracy limit factor</strong> of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer.</p>
<h2 id="Knee-Point-Voltage-of-Current-Transformer">Knee Point Voltage of Current Transformer</h2>
<p><strong>Knee point <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer</strong> is significance of saturation level of a  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  transformer core mainly used for protection purposes. The sinusoidal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of rated frequency is applied to the secondary terminals of CT, with other winding being open circuited which increased by10%, cause the exiting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to increase by 50%. </p>
