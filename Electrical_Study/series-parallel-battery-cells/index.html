<h2 id="Batter-Cells">Battery Cells</h2>
<p> <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">Battery</a>  is an electrical element where <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >electrical potential</a> is produced due to chemical reaction. Every electrochemical reaction has its limit of producing <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >electric potential difference</a> between two electrodes.</p>
<p><strong> <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">Battery</a>  cells</strong> are those where these electro-chemical reactions take place to produce the limited electric potential difference. For achieving desired <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >electric potential difference</a> across the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  terminals multiple numbers of cells are to be connected in series. Hence it can be concluded like that, a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is a combination of several cells where a cell is a unit of a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  .  For example, Nickel-cadmium <strong>battery cells</strong> normally develop about 1.2 V per cell while <a href="../working-of-lead-acid-battery-lead-acid-secondary-storage-battery/index.html" > <a href="../working-of-lead-acid-battery-lead-acid-secondary-storage-battery/index.html" title="Working of Lead Acid Battery">lead acid  battery</a>  </a> develop about 2 V per cell. So a 12 volt  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  will have total 6 number of cells connected in series.</p>
<h2 id="EMF-of-Battery">EMF of Battery</h2>
<p>If anyone just measures the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >electric potential difference</a> between two terminals of a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  when load is not connected with the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  , he or she will get the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> developed in the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  when there is no  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> flowing through it. This <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is generally referred as electromotive force or <strong>emf of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  </strong>. It is also referred as no-load <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  .</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Terminal-Voltage-of-Battery">Terminal Voltage of Battery</h2>
<p><strong>Terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  </strong> is the potential difference across its terminals when the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is being drawn from it. Actually when load is connected with the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  , there will be load current  flowing through it. As a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is an electrical equipment, it must have some <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">electrical resistance</a> inside it. Because of this <strong>internal resistance of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  </strong>, there will be some <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops across it. So, if any one measures the terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the load i.e. <strong>terminal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  </strong> when load is connected, he or she will get the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> which is less than emf of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  by internal <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  .</p>

<h3 id="Series-Batteries">Series Batteries</h3>
<p>When in a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  , positive terminal of one cell is connected with the negative terminal of succeeding cell, then the cells are said to be series connected or simply <strong>series  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> </strong>. Here, overall emf of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  is algebraic sum of all individual cells connected in series.

If E is the overall emf of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  combined by n number cells and E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, E<sub>3</sub>, …………… E<sub>n</sub> are the emfs of individual cells.<br />

<h3 id="Parallel-Batteries">Parallel Batteries</h3>
<p>When positive terminals of all cells are connected together and similarly negative terminals of these cells are connected together in a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  , then the cells are said to be connected in parallel. These combinations are also referred as <strong>parallel   <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">batteries</a> </strong>. If emf of each cell is identical, then the emf of the  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  combined by n numbers of cells connected in parallel, is equal to the emf of each cell.

<p>As we said earlier, the cells in a  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  can also be connected in mixture of both series and parallel. These combinations are some time referred as <strong>series parallel  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a> </strong>. A load can require both <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" >voltage</a> and  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> more than that of an individual  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  cell. For achieving the required load voltage, the desired numbers of  <a href="../battery-history-and-working-principle-of-batteries/index.html" title="Battery">battery</a>  cells can be combined in series and for achieving the required load current, desired numbers of these series combinations are connected in parallel. Let m, numbers of series, each containing n numbers of identical cells, are connected in parallel. </p>

<p>Again assume emf of each cell is E and internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of each cell is r.
