<h2 id="Theory-of-Transformer">Theory of Transformer</h2>
<p>We have discussed about the theory of <a href="../ideal-transformer/index.html" >ideal transformer</a> for better understanding of actual elementary <strong>theory of transformer</strong>. Now we will go through the  practical aspects one by one of an <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a> and try to draw <strong>vector diagram of transformer</strong> in every step. As we said that, in an ideal transformer; there are no core <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Losses in Transformer">losses in transformer</a> i.e. loss free core of transformer. But in practical transformer, there are hysteresis and <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" >losses in transformer</a> core.</p>
<h2 id="Theory-of-Transformer-on-No-Load">Theory of Transformer on No-Load</h2>
<h3>Theory of Transformer On No-load, and Having No Winding Resistance and No Leakage Reactance of Transformer</h3>
<p>Let us consider one <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" title="Electrical Transformer">electrical transformer</a> with only core losses, which means, it has only core losses but no copper loss and no <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/index.html" >leakage reactance of transformer</a>. When an alternating source is applied in the primary, the source will supply the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> for magnetizing the <a href="../core-of-transformer-and-design-of-transformer-core/index.html" >core of transformer</a>. But this  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is not the actual magnetizing current, it is little bit greater than actual magnetizing current. Actually, total  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> supplied from the source has two components, one is magnetizing  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  which is merely utilized for magnetizing the core and other component of the source  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is consumed for compensating the core <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Losses in Transformer">losses in transformer</a>. Because of this core loss component, the source  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in <strong>transformer on no-load</strong> condition supplied from the source as source  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is not exactly at 90&deg; lags of supply voltage, but it lags behind an angle &theta; is less than 90&deg;.</p>
</p>
<p>If total  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> supplied from source is I<sub>o</sub>, it will have one component in phase with supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V<sub>1</sub> and this component of the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>w</sub> is core loss component. This component is taken in phase with source voltage, because it is associated with active or working <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" >losses in transformer</a>. Other component of the source  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is denoted as I<sub>&mu;</sub>. </p>
<p>This component produces the alternating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> in the core, so it is watt-less; means it is reactive part of the transformer source current. </p>
<p>Hence I<sub>&mu;</sub> will be in quadrature with V<sub>1</sub> and in phase with alternating flux &Phi;.</p>
<p> Hence, total primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in <strong>transformer on no-load</strong> condition can be represented as<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/tot-01-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now you have seen how simple is to explain the <strong>theory of transformer</strong> in no-load.</p>

<h2 id="Theory-of-Transformer-on-Load">Theory of Transformer on Load</h2>
<h3>Theory of Transformer On Load But Having No Winding Resistance and Leakage Reactance</h3>
<p>Now we will examine the behavior of above said <strong>transformer on load</strong>, that means load is connected to the secondary terminals. Consider, transformer having core loss but no copper loss and leakage reactance. Whenever load is connected to the secondary winding, load current  will start to flow through the load as well as secondary winding. This load current  solely depends upon the characteristics of the load and also upon secondary <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> of the transformer. This  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is called secondary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or load current, here it is denoted as I<sub>2</sub>. As I<sub>2</sub> is flowing through the secondary, a self mmf in secondary winding will be produced. Here it is N<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>, where, N<sub>2</sub> is the number of turns of the secondary winding of transformer.<br />
<img src="../images/on-load-primary-current.gif"  style="float:right;" alt="primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in transformer on load" title="On-load Primary Current in Transformer"/></p>
<p>This mmf or magneto motive force in the secondary winding produces flux &phi;<sub>2</sub>. This &phi;<sub>2</sub> will oppose the main magnetizing flux and momentarily weakens the main flux and tries to reduce primary self induced emf E<sub>1</sub>. If E<sub>1</sub> falls down below the primary source <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V<sub>1</sub>, there will be an extra  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flowing from source to primary winding. This extra primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>2</sub>&prime; produces extra flux &phi;&prime; in the core which will neutralize the secondary counter flux &phi;<sub>2</sub>. Hence the main magnetizing flux of core, &Phi; remains unchanged irrespective of load.</p>
<p> So total current, this transformer draws from source can be divided into two components, first one is utilized for magnetizing the core and compensating the core loss i.e. I<sub>o</sub>. It is no-load component of the primary current. Second one is utilized for compensating the counter flux of the secondary winding. It is known as load component of the primary current.</p>
<p>Hence total no load primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  I<sub>1</sub> of a <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a> having no winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> and <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Leakage-Reactance-of-Transformer" title="Leakage Reactance of Transformer">leakage reactance</a> can be represented as follows<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/tot-02-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Where &theta;<sub>2</sub> is the angle between Secondary Voltage and Secondary Current of transformer.</p>
<p>Now we will proceed one further step toward more practical aspect of a transformer.</p>
<h3>Theory of Transformer On Load, With Resistive Winding, But No Leakage Reactance</h3>
<p>Now, consider the winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> of transformer but no leakage reactance. So far we have discussed about the transformer which has ideal windings, means winding with no <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> and leakage reactance, but now we will consider one transformer which has internal <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in the winding but no leakage reactance. As the windings are resistive, there would be a <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop in the windings.<br />
<img src="../images/on-load-vector-diagram.gif" style="float:right;" alt="vector diagram of transformer on load" title="Vector diagram of transformer on-load with resistive windings"/></p>
<p> We have proved earlier that, total primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  from the source on load is I<sub>1</sub>. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop in the primary winding with <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, R<sub>1</sub> is R<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub>. Obviously, induced emf across primary winding E<sub>1</sub>, is not exactly equal to source <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V<sub>1</sub>. E<sub>1</sub> is less than V<sub>1</sub> by <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop I<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub>.<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/tot-03-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Again in the case of secondary, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> induced across the secondary winding, E<sub>2</sub> does not totally appear across the load since it also drops by an amount I<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, where R<sub>2</sub> is the secondary winding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> and I<sub>2</sub> is secondary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  or load current.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equation of the secondary side of the transformer will be<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/tot-04-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center></p>
<h3>Theory of Transformer On Load, With Resistance As Well As Leakage Reactance in Transformer Windings</h3>
<p>Now we will consider the condition, when there is <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Leakage-Reactance-of-Transformer" title="Leakage Reactance of Transformer">leakage reactance of transformer</a> as well as winding resistance of transformer.<br />
<img src="../images/vector-diagram-of-transformer.gif"  alt="vector diagram of transformer" title="Vector Diagram of Transformer"/><br />
Let leakage reactances of primary and secondary windings of the transformer are X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> respectively.</p>
<p>Hence total <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/index.html" >impedance of primary and secondary winding of transformer</a> with resistance R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> respectively, can be represented as,<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/tot-05-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
We have already established the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equation of a <strong>transformer on load</strong>, with only <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s in the windings, where <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drops in the windings occur only due to resistive <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop. But when we consider leakage reactances of transformer windings, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> drop occurs in the winding not only because of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, it is because of <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Impedance-of-Transformer" title="Impedance of Transformer">impedance of transformer</a> windings. Hence, actual <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equation of a transformer can easily be determined by just replacing <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s R<sub>1</sub> &amp; R<sub>2</sub> in the previously established <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equations by Z<sub>1</sub> and Z<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> equations are,<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/tot-06-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
<a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">Resistance</a> drops are in the direction of  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  vector but, reactive drop will be perpendicular to the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  vector as shown in the above <strong>vector diagram of transformer</strong>.<br />
