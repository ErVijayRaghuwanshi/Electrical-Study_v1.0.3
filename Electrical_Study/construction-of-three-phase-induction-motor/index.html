</div>
<p>The <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is the most widely used <a href="../electrical-motor-types-classification-and-history-of-motor/index.html" title="Types Classification and History of Motor">electrical motor</a>. Almost 80% of the mechanical power used by industries is provided by <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motors</a> because of its simple and rugged construction, low cost, good operating characteristics, absence of commutator and good speed regulation. In <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> the power is transferred from stator to rotor winding through induction. The <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">Induction motor</a> is also called <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">asynchronous motor</a> as it runs at a speed other than the synchronous speed. </p>
<p>Like any other electrical motor <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> also have two main parts namely rotor and stator</p>
<ol>
<li>Stator: As its name indicates stator is a stationary part of induction motor. A stator winding is placed in the stator of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> and the three phase supply is given to it.</li>
<li>Rotor: The rotor is a rotating part of induction motor. The rotor is connected to the mechanical load through the shaft.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rotor of the <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> are further classified as</p>
<ol>
<li>Squirrel cage rotor,</li>
<li>Slip ring rotor or wound rotor or phase wound rotor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending upon the type of rotor construction used the <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> are classified as:</p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Squirrel cage induction motor,</li>
<li>Slip ring <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> or wound <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> or phase wound induction motor.</li>
</ol>
<p>The construction of stator for both the kinds of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> remains the same and is discussed in brief in next paragraph. </p>
<p>The other parts, which are required to complete the induction motor, are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shaft for transmitting the torque to the load. This shaft is made up of steel.</li>
<li>Bearings for supporting the rotating shaft. </li>
<li>One of the problems with electrical motor is the production of heat during its rotation. In order to overcome this problem we need fan for cooling.</li>
<li>For receiving external electrical connection Terminal box is needed.</li>
<li>There is a small distance between rotor and stator which usually varies from 0.4 mm to 4 mm. Such a distance is called air gap.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Stator-of-Three-Phase-Induction-Motor">Stator of Three Phase Induction Motor</h3>
<p>The stator of the <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> consists of three main parts :</p>
<ol>
<li>Stator frame,</li>
<li>Stator core,</li>
<li>Stator winding or field winding.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Stator-Frame">Stator Frame</h4>
<p><div id="attachment_11378" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img src="../images/stator-of-motor.jpg" alt="stator of motor" width="300" height="310" class="size-full wp-image-11378" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Stator Frame</p></div><br />
It is the outer most part of the three phase induction motor. Its main function is to support the stator core and the field winding. It acts as a covering and it provide protection and mechanical strength to all the inner parts of the induction motor. The frame is either made up of die cast or fabricated steel. The frame of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> should be very strong and rigid as the air gap length of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is very small, otherwise rotor will not remain concentric with stator, which will give rise to unbalanced magnetic pull.<br />
<div id="attachment_11380" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img src="../images/stator-lamination-1-1-14.jpg" alt="stator lamination of induction motor" width="300" height="286" class="size-full wp-image-11380" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Stator Lamination</p></div></p>
<h4 id="Stator-Core">Stator Core</h4>
<p> The main function of the stator core is to carry the alternating flux. In order to reduce the <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  loss, the stator core is laminated. These laminated types of structure are made up of stamping which is about 0.4 to 0.5 mm thick. All the stamping are stamped together to form stator core, which is then housed in stator frame. The stamping is generally made up of silicon steel, which helps to reduce the <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Hysteresis Losses ">hysteresis loss</a> occurring in motor.</p>
<h4 id="Stator-Winding-or-Field-Winding">Stator Winding or Field Winding</h4>
<p>The slots on the periphery of stator core of the <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> carries three phase windings. This three phase winding is supplied by three phase ac supply. The three phases of the winding are connected either in star or delta depending upon which type of starting method is used. The squirrel cage motor is mostly started by star – delta stater and hence the stator of squirrel cage motor is delta connected. The slip ring <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> are started by inserting <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s so, the stator winding of slip ring <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> can be connected either in star or delta. The winding wound on the stator of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is also called field winding and when this winding is excited by three phase ac supply it produces a rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a>.<br />

<h3 id="Types-of-Three-Phase-Induction-Motor">Types of Three Phase Induction Motor</h3>
<ol>
<li><span class="Green">Squirrel cage three phase induction motor:</span> The rotor of the squirrel cage <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is cylindrical in shape and have slots on its periphery. The slots are not made parallel to each other but are bit skewed (skewing is not shown in the figure of squirrel cadge rotor beside) as the skewing prevents magnetic locking of stator and rotor teeth and makes the working of motor more smooth and quieter. The squirrel cage rotor consists of aluminum, brass or copper bars (copper bras rotor is shown in the figure beside). These aluminum, brass or copper bars are called rotor conductors and are placed in the slots on the periphery of the rotor. The rotor conductors are permanently shorted by the copper or aluminum rings called the end rings. In order to provide mechanical strength these rotor conductor are braced to the end ring and hence form a complete closed circuit resembling like a cage and hence got its name as "squirrel cage induction motor". The squirrel cage rotor winding is made symmetrical. As the bars are permanently shorted by end rings, the rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> is very small and it is not possible to add external <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> as the bars are permanently shorted. The absence of slip ring and brushes make the construction of Squirrel cage <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> very simple and robust and hence widely used three phase induction motor. These motors have the advantage of adapting any number of pole pairs. The below diagram shows squirrel cage induction rotor having aluminum bars short circuit by aluminum end rings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_11392" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img src="../images/rotor-of-induction-motor.jpg" alt="Squirrel Cage Induction Rotor" width="300" height="217" class="size-full wp-image-11392" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Squirrel Cage Induction Rotor</p></div><br />
<b>Advantages of squirrel cage induction rotor-</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Its construction is very simple and rugged.</li>
<li>As there are no brushes and slip ring, these motors requires less maintenance.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Applications: </b><br />
Squirrel cage <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> is used in lathes, drilling machine, fan, blower printing machines etc
</li>
<li><span class="Green">Slip ring or wound <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> :</span>  In this type of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> the rotor is wound for the same number of poles as that of stator but it has less number of slots and has less turns per phase of a heavier conductor.The rotor also  carries star or delta winding similar to that of stator winding. The rotor consists of numbers of slots and rotor winding are placed inside these slots. The three end terminals are connected together to form star connection. As its name indicates three phase slip ring <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> consists of slip rings connected on same shaft as that of rotor. The three ends of three phase windings are permanently connected to these slip rings. The external <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> can be easily connected through the brushes and slip rings and hence used for speed control and improving the starting torque of three phase induction motor. The brushes are used to carry  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to  and from the rotor winding. These brushes are further connected to three phase star connected <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>s. At starting, the resistance are connected in rotor circuit and is gradually cut out as the rotor pick up its speed. When the motor is running the slip ring are shorted by connecting a metal collar, which connect all slip ring together  and the brushes are also removed. This reduces wear and tear of the brushes. Due to presence of slip rings and brushes the rotor construction becomes somewhat complicated therefore it is less used as compare to squirrel cage induction motor.<br />
