<p>A <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" >three phase induction motor</a> is basically a constant speed motor so itâ€™s somewhat difficult to control its speed. The speed control of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" >induction motor</a> is done at the cost of decrease in efficiency and low <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" >electrical power factor</a>. Before discussing the methods to <strong>control the speed of three phase induction motor</strong> one should know the basic formulas of speed and torque of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> as the methods of speed control depends upon these formulas.</p>

<li> <span class="Green">V / f  control or frequency control -</span>  Whenever three phase supply is given to <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> rotating <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit"><a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/index.html" title="Magnetic Field and Magnetic Circuit">magnetic field</a></a> is produced which rotates at synchronous speed given by<br />
<center><img src="../equations/spim-12-06-14-01.gif" alt=""></center><br />
In <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> emf is induced by induction similar to that of transformer which is given by<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-04.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Where K is the winding constant, T is the number of turns per phase and f is frequency. Now if we change frequency synchronous speed changes but with decrease in frequency flux will increase  and this change in value of flux causes saturation of rotor and stator cores which will further cause increase in no load current  of the motor . So, its important to maintain flux , &phi; constant and it is only possible if we change <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> . i.e if we decrease frequency flux increases but at the same time if we decrease <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> flux will also decease causing no change in flux and hence it remains constant. So, here we are keeping the ratio of V/ f as constant. Hence its name is V/ f method. For controlling the speed of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> by V/ f method we have to supply variable <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and frequency which is easily obtained by using converter and inverter set.</li>
<li><span class="Green">Controlling supply voltage:</span> The torque produced by running <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is given by<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-05.gif" alt=""></center><br />
In low slip region (sX)<sup>2</sup>  is very very small as compared to R<sub>2</sub> . So, it can be neglected. So torque becomes<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-06.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Since  rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, R<sub>2</sub> is constant so the equation of torque further reduces to<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-07.gif" alt=""></center><br />
We know that rotor induced emf E<sub>2</sub> &prop;  V. So, T &prop; sV<sup>2</sup>.<br />
From the equation above it is clear that if we decrease supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> torque will also decrease. But for supplying the same load, the torque must remains the same and it is only possible if we increase the slip and if the slip increases the motor will run at reduced speed . This method of speed control is rarely used because small change in speed requires large  reduction in voltage, and hence the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  drawn by motor increases, which cause over heating of  induction motor. </li>
<li><span class="Green">Changing the number of stator poles :</span> The stator poles can be changed by two methods
<li><span class="Green">Multiple stator winding method.</span></li>
<li><span class="Green">Pole amplitude modulation method (PAM)</span></li>
<li><span class="Green">Multiple stator winding method â€“</span> In this method of speed control of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> , the stator is provided by two separate winding. These two stator windings are electrically isolated from each other and are wound for two different pole numbers. Using switching arrangement, at a time , supply is given to one winding only and hence speed control is possible. Disadvantages  of this method is that the smooth speed control is not possible . This method is more costly and less efficient as two different stator winding are required. This method of speed control can only be applied for squirrel cage motor.</li>
<li><span class="Green">Pole amplitude modulation method (PAM) â€“</span> In this method of speed control of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> the original sinusoidal mmf wave is modulated by another sinusoidal mmf wave having different number of poles.</li>
<p>Let   f<sub>1</sub>(&theta;)  be the original mmf  wave of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> whose speed is to be controlled.</p>
<p>      f<sub>2</sub>(&theta;)  be the modulation mmf wave. </p>
<p>         P<sub>1</sub> be the number of poles of <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> whose speed is to be controlled.</p>
<p>         P<sub>2</sub> be the number of poles of modulation wave.<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-08.gif" alt=""></center><br />
After modulation resultant mmf wave<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-09.gif" alt=""></center><br />
So we get, resultant mmf wave<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-10.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Therefore the resultant mmf wave will have two different number of poles<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-11.gif" alt=""></center></p>
<p>Therefore by changing the number of poles we can easily change the speed of three phase induction motor.</li>
<li><span class="Green">Adding rheostat in the stator circuit -</span>  In this method of speed control of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> rheostat is added in the stator circuit due to this <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> gets dropped .In case of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a>  torque produced  is given by T &prop; sV<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>. If we decrease supply <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> torque will also decrease. But for supplying the same load , the torque must remains the same and it is only possible if we increase the slip and if the slip increase motor will run reduced speed.</li>

<h3 id="Speed-Control-from-Rotor-Side">Speed Control from Rotor Side</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Adding external  <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> on rotor side â€“ </b>In this method of speed control of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> external <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> are added on rotor side. The equation of torque for <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-12.gif" alt=""></center></p>
<p>The <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> operates in low slip region .In low slip region term (sX)<sup>2</sup> becomes very very small as compared to R<sub>2</sub>. So, it can be neglected . and also E<sub>2</sub> is constant. So the equation of torque after simplification becomes,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-13.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now if we increase rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a>, R<sub>2</sub> torque decreases but to supply the same load torque must remains constant. So, we increase slip, which will further results in decrease in rotor speed. Thus by adding additional <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in rotor circuit we can decrease the speed of  three phase induction motor. The main advantage of this method is that with addition of external resistance starting torque increases but this method of speed control of  <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> also suffers from some disadvantages :</p>
<ol>
<li>The speed above the normal value is not possible.</li>
<li>Large speed change requires large value of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> and if such large value of resistance is added in the circuit it will cause large copper loss and hence reduction in efficiency.</li>
<li>Presence of <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> causes more losses.</li>
<li>This method cannot be used for squirrel cage induction motor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b> Cascade control method â€“ </b>In this method of speed control of  three phase induction motor, the two <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> are connected on common shaft and hence called cascaded motor. One motor is the called the main motor and another motor is called the auxiliary motor. The three phase supply is given to the stator of the main motor while the auxiliary motor is derived at a slip frequency from the slip ring of main motor.
<p>Let N<sub>S1</sub> be the synchronous speed of main motor. </p>
<p>N<sub>S2</sub> be the synchronous speed of auxiliary motor.</p>
<p>P<sub>1</sub>  be the number of poles of the main motor.</p>
<p>P<sub>2</sub>  be the number of poles of the auxiliary motor.</p>
<p>F is the supply frequency.</p>
<p>F<sub>1</sub> is the frequency of rotor induced emf of main motor.</p>
<p>N is the speed of set and it remains same for both the main and auxiliary motor as both the motors are mounted on common shaft.</p>
<p>S<sub>1</sub> is the slip of main motor.<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
The auxiliary motor is supplied with same frequency as the main motor  i.e<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-15.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now put the value of<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-16.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now at no load , the speed of auxiliary rotor is almost same as its synchronous speed i.e N = N<sub>S2</sub><br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-17.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now rearrange the above equation and find out the value of N, we get,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/scotpim-12-06-14-18.gif" alt=""></center></p>
<p>This cascaded set of two motors will now run at new speed having number of poles (P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub>). In the above method the torque produced by the main and auxiliary motor will act in same direction, resulting in number of poles (P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub>). Such type of cascading is called cumulative cascading. There is one more type of cascading in which the torque produced by the main motor is in opposite direction to that of auxiliary motor. Such type of cascading is called differential cascading; resulting in speed corresponds to number of poles (P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>2</sub>).<br />
In this method of speed control  of  three phase induction motor, four different speeds can be obtained</p>
<ol>
<li>When only main <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> work, having speed corresponds to N<sub>S1</sub> = 120 F / P<sub>1</sub>.</li>
<li>When only auxiliary <a href="../induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/index.html" title="Induction Motor">induction motor</a> work, having speed corresponds to N<sub>S2</sub> = 120 F / P<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>When cumulative cascading is done, then the complete set runs at a speed of N = 120F / (P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub>).</li>
<li>When differential cascading is done, then the complete set runs at a speed of N = 120F / (P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>2</sub>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b> Injecting slip frequency emf into rotor side -</b> when the speed control of  <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is done by adding <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> in rotor circuit, some part of power called, the slip power is lost as I<sup>2</sup>R losses. Therefore the efficiency of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is reduced by this method of speed control. This slip power loss can be recovered and supplied back in order to improve the overall efficiency of <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> and this scheme of recovering the power is called slip power recovery scheme and this is done by connecting an external source of emf of slip frequency to the rotor circuit. The injected emf can either oppose the rotor induced emf or aids the rotor induced emf. If it oppose the rotor induced emf, the total rotor <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> increases and hence speed decreases and if the injected emf aids the main rotor emf the total <a href="../electrical-resistance-and-laws-of-resistance/index.html" title="Know about the electrical resistance in detail.">resistance</a> decreases and hence speed increases. Therefore by injecting induced emf in rotor circuit the speed can be easily controlled. The main advantage of this type of speed control of  <a href="../working-principle-of-three-phase-induction-motor/index.html" title="Working Principle of Three Phase Induction Motor">three phase induction motor</a> is that wide range of speed control is possible whether its above normal or below normal speed.</li>
