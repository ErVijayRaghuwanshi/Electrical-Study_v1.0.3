<h2 id="What-is-Tertiary-Winding ? What-is-Three-Winding-Transformer ?">What is Tertiary Winding ? What is Three Winding Transformer ?</h2>
<p>In some high rating transformer, one winding in addition to its primary and secondary winding is used. This additional winding, apart from primary and secondary windings, is known as <strong>Tertiary winding of transformer</strong>. Because of this third winding, the transformer is called <strong>three winding transformer</strong> or <strong>3 winding transformer</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Advantages-of-Using-Tertiary-Winding-in-Transformer">Advantages of Using Tertiary Winding in Transformer</h2>
<p><strong>Tertiary winding</strong> is provided in <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a> to meet one or more of the following requirements-</p>
<ol>
<li>It reduces the unbalancing in the primary due to unbalancing in three phase load.</li>
<li>It redistributes the flow of fault current.</li>
<li>Sometime it is required to supply an auxiliary load in different <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level in addition to its main secondary load. This secondary load can be taken from tertiary winding of <strong>three winding transformer</strong>.</li>
<li>As the <strong>tertiary winding</strong> is connected in delta formation in <strong>3 winding transformer</strong>, it assists in limitation of fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the event of a short circuit from line to neutral.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Stabilization-by-Tertiary-Winding-of-Transformer">Stabilization by Tertiary Winding of Transformer</h2>
<p>In star-star transformer comprising three single units or a single unit with 5 limb core offers high impedance to the flow of unbalanced load between the line and neutral.</p>
<p>This is because, in both of these transformers, there is very low reluctance return path of unbalanced flux.</p>
<p>If any transformer has N turns in winding and reluctance of the magnetic path is R<sub>L</sub>, then,<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/twt-01-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Where I and &Phi; are  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> and flux in the transformer.<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/twt-02-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
Now, from equation (1) &amp; (2), it can be rewritten as,<br />
<center><img src="../transformer-equation/twt-03-13-05-14.gif" alt=""></center><br />
From this above mathematical expression it is found that, impedance is inversely proportional to reluctance. The impedance offered by the return path of unbalanced load current  is very high where very low reluctance return path is provided for unbalanced flux.<br />
<img src="../images/tertiary-winding.gif" alt="tertiary winding of transformer" title="Schematic Diagram of Tertiary Winding of Transformer" class="alignleft"/><br />
In other words, very high impedance to the flow of unbalanced  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in 3 phase system is offered between line and neutral. Any unbalanced  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in <a href="../three-phase-circuit-star-and-delta-system/index.html" title="Three Phase Star and Delta System">three phase system</a> can be divided into three sets of components likewise positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence components. The zero sequence  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is actually co-phasial  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in three lines. If value of co-phasial  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in each line is I<sub>o</sub>, then total  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  flows through the neutral of secondary side of transformer is I<sub>n</sub> = 3.I<sub>o</sub>. This  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  cannot be balanced by primary  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  as the zero sequence  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  cannot flow through the isolated neutral star connected primary. Hence the said  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> in the secondary side set up a <a href="../what-is-magnetic-field/#Magnetic-Flux-or-Magnetic-Lines-of-Force" title="Magnetic Flux or Magnetic Lines of Force">magnetic flux</a> in the core. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, low reluctance path is available for the zero sequence flux in a bank of single phase units and in the 5 limb core consequently; the impedance offered to the zero sequence  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is very high. The delta connected tertiary winding of transformer permits the circulation of zero sequence  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in it. This circulating  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in this delta winding balances the zero sequence component of unbalance load, hence prevents unnecessary development of unbalance zero sequence flux in the transformer core. In few words it can be said that, placement of tertiary winding in star - star-neutral transformer considerably reduces the zero sequence impedance of transformer.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Rating-of-Tertiary-Winding-of-Transformer">Rating of Tertiary Winding of Transformer</h2>
<p>Rating of <strong>tertiary winding of transformer</strong> depends upon its use. If it has to supply additional load, its winding cross - section and design philosophy is decided as per load, and three phase dead short circuit on its terminal with power flow from both sides of HV &amp; MV.</p>
<p>In case it is to be provided for stabilizing purpose only, its cross - section and design has to be decided from thermal and mechanical consideration for the short duration fault currents during various fault conditions single line -to-ground fault being the most onerous.</p>
