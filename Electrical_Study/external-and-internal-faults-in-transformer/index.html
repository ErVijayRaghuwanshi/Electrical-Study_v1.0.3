<h2 id="External-Faults-in-Power-Transformer">External Faults in Power Transformer</h2>
<h3 id="External-Short-Circuit-of-Power-Transformer">External Short - Circuit of Power Transformer</h3>
<div>The short - circuit may occurs in two or three phases of <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system. The level of fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is always high enough. It depends upon the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> which has been short - circuited and upon the impedance of the circuit up to the fault point. The copper loss of the fault feeding transformer is abruptly increased. This increasing copper loss causes internal heating in the transformer. Large fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  also produces severe mechanical stresses in the transformer. The maximum mechanical stresses occurs during first cycle of symmetrical fault current. </div>
<h3 id="High-Voltage-Disturbance-in-Power-Transformer">High Voltage Disturbance in Power Transformer </h3>
<div>High Voltage Disturbance in Power Transformer are of two kinds, </div>
<div>(1) Transient Surge Voltage</div>
<div>(2) Power Frequency Over Voltage</div>
<h4 id="Transient-Surge-Voltage">Transient Surge Voltage</h4>
<div>High <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and high frequency surge may arise in the power system due to any of the following causes,</div>
<div>(a) Arcing ground if neutral point is isolated.</div>
<div>(b) Switching operation of different electrical equipment.</div>
<div>(c) Atmospheric Lightening Impulse.</div>
<div>Whatever may be the causes of surge voltage, it is after all a traveling wave having high and steep wave form and also having high frequency. This wave travels in the <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system network, upon reaching in the <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" title="Electrical Power Transformer">power transformer</a>, it causes breakdown the insulation between turns adjacent to line terminal, which may create short circuit between turns.</div>
<h4 id="Power-Frequency-Over-Voltage">Power Frequency Over Voltage</h4>
<div>There may be always a chance of system over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> due to sudden disconnection of large load. Although the amplitude of this <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is higher than its normal level but frequency is same as it was in normal condition. Over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in the system causes an increase in stress on the insulation of transformer. As we know that, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V = 4.44&Phi;.f.T &rArr; V &prop; &Phi;, increased <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> causes proportionate increase in the working flux. This therefore causes, increased in iron loss and dis - proportionately large increase in magnetizing current. The increase flux is diverted from the transformer core to other steel structural parts of the transformer. Core bolts which normally carry little flux, may be subjected to a large component of flux diverted from saturated region of the core alongside. Under such condition, the bolt may be rapidly heated up and destroys their own insulation as well as winding insulation. </div>
<h4 id="Under-Frequency-Effect-in-Power-Transformer">Under Frequency Effect in Power Transformer</h4>
<div>As, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> V = 4.44&Phi;.f.T &rArr; V &prop; &Phi;.f as the number of turns in the winding is fixed. </div>
<div>Therefore,  &Phi; &prop; V/f</div>
<div>From, this equation it is clear that if frequency reduces in a system, the flux in the core increases, the effect are more or less similar to that of the over voltage.</div>
<h2 id="Internal-Faults-in-Power-Transformer">Internal Faults in Power Transformer</h2>
<div>The principle faults which occurs inside a <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" title="Electrical Power Transformer">power transformer</a> are categorized as,</div>
<div>(1) Insulation breakdown between winding and earth</div>
<div>(2) Insulation breakdown in between different phases</div>
<div>(3) Insulation breakdown in between adjacent turns i.e. inter - turn fault</div>
<div>(4) Transformer core fault</div>
<h3 id="Internal-Earth-Faults-in-Power-Transformer">Internal Earth Faults in Power Transformer</h3>
<h4>Internal Earth Faults in a Star Connected Winding with Neutral Point Earthed through an Impedance</h4>
<div>In this case the fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is dependent on the value of earthing impedance and is also proportional to the distance of the fault point from neutral point as the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> at the point depends upon, the number of winding turns come under across neutral and fault point. If the distance between fault point and neutral point is more, the number of turns come under this distance is also more, hence <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across the neutral point and fault point is high which causes higher fault current. So, in few words it can be said that, the value of fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  depends on the value of earthing impedance as well as the distance between the faulty point and neutral point. The fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  also depends up on <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Leakage-Reactance-of-Transformer" title="Leakage Reactance of Transformer">leakage reactance</a> of the portion of the winding across the fault point and neutral. But compared to the earthing impedance,it is very low and it is obviously ignored as it comes in series with comparatively much higher earthing impedance. </div>
<h4>Internal Earth Faults in a Star Connected Winding with Neutral Point Solidly Earthed</h4>
<div>In this case, earthing impedance is ideally zero. The fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is dependent up on <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Leakage-Reactance-of-Transformer" title="Leakage Reactance of Transformer">leakage reactance</a> of the portion of winding comes across faulty point and neutral point of transformer. The fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is also dependent on the distance between neutral point and fault point in the transformer. As said in previous case the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across these two points depends upon the number of winding turn comes across faulty point and neutral point. So in star connected winding with neutral point solidly earthed, the fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  depends upon two main factors, first the <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Leakage-Reactance-of-Transformer" title="Leakage Reactance of Transformer">leakage reactance</a> of the winding comes across faulty point and neutral point and secondly the distance between faulty point and neutral point. But the <a href="../resistance-leakage-reactance-or-impedance-of-transformer/#Leakage-Reactance-of-Transformer" title="Leakage Reactance of Transformer">leakage reactance</a> of the winding varies in complex manner with position of the fault in the winding. It is seen that the reactance decreases very rapidly for fault point approaching the neutral and hence the fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is highest for the fault near the neutral end. So at this point, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> available for fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is low and at the same time the reactance opposes the fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is also low, hence the value of fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is high enough. Again at fault point away from the neutral point, the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> available for fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  is high but at the same time reactance offered by the winding portion between fault point and neutral point is high. It can be noticed that the fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  stays a very high level throughout the winding. In other word, the fault  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  maintain a very high magnitude irrelevant to the position of the fault on winding.</div>
<h3 id="Internal-Phase-to-Phase-Faults-in-Power-Transformer">Internal Phase to Phase Faults in Power Transformer</h3>
<div>Phase to phase fault in the transformer are rare. If such a fault does occur, it will give rise to substantial  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> to operate instantaneous over  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  relay on the primary side as well as the differential relay. </div>
<h3 id="Inter-Turns-Fault-in-Power-Transformer">Inter Turns Fault in Power Transformer</h3>
<div>Power Transformer connected with electrical extra high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> transmission system, is very likely to be subjected to high magnitude, steep fronted and high frequency impulse <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> due to lightening surge on the transmission line. The <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> stresses between winding turns become so large, it can not sustain the stress and causing insulation failure between inter - turns in some points. Also LV winding is stressed because of the transferred surge voltage. Very large number of Power Transformer failure arise from fault between turns. Inter turn fault may also be occurred due to mechanical forces between turns originated by external short circuit.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Core-Fault-in-Power-Transformer">Core Fault in Power Transformer</h2>
<div>In any portion of the core lamination is damaged, or lamination of the core is bridged by any conducting material causes sufficient <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  to flow, hence, this part of the core becomes over heated. Some times, insulation of bolts (Used for tightening the core lamination together) fails which also permits sufficient <a href="../hysteresis-eddy-current-iron-or-core-losses-and-copper-loss-in-transformer/index.html" title="Eddy Current">eddy current</a>  to flow through the bolt and causing over heating. These insulation failure in lamination and core bolts causes severe local heating. Although these local heating, causes additional core loss but can not create any noticeable change in input and output  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a> in the transformer, hence these faults can not be detected by normal electrical protection scheme. This is desirable to detect the local over heating condition of the transformer core before any major fault occurs. Excessive over heating leads to breakdown of transformer insulating oil with evolution of gases. These gases are accumulated in Buchholz relay and actuating Buchholz Alarm.</div>
