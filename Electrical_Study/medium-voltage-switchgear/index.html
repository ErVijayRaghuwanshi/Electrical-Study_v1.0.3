<p>From 3KV to 36KV switchgear system is categorized as medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear or MV switchgear. These <a href="../electrical-switchgear-protection/index.html">switchgears</a> are of many types. They may metal enclosed indoor type, metal enclosed outdoor type, outdoor type without metal enclosure, etc. The interruption medium of this switchgear may be oil, SF<sub>6</sub> and vacuum. The main requirement of MV power network is to interrupt  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  during faulty condition irrespective of what <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">type of CB</a> is used in the MV switchgear system. Although it may be capable of functioning in other conditions also.</p>
<p>A medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear, should be capable of,<br />
1)	Normal ON/OFF switching operation.<br />
2)	Short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  interruption.<br />
3)	Switching of capacitive currents.<br />
4)	Switching of inductive currents, and<br />
5)	Some special application. </p>
<p>All the above mentioned function must be carried out with high degree of safety and reliability. </p>
<h2 id="Short-Circuit-Current-Interruption">Short Circuit Current Interruption</h2>
<p>The main focus of <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">circuit breaker</a> design is to that all <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> should be capable of interrupting short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  with high degree of reliability and safety. The number of faulty tripping occurred during total life span of a <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> mainly depends upon location of the system, quality of system and environment condition. If the number of tripping is much high, the best choice is <a href="../vacuum-circuit-breaker-or-vcb-and-vacuum-interrupter/index.html">vacuum circuit breaker</a> as it may not require any maintenance up to 100 faulty trippings with short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  up to 25KA. Whereas other <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" >circuit breakers</a> require maintenance after 15 to 20 faulty trippings with same <a href="../short-circuit-current-of-circuit-breaker/index.html">short circuit  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of CB</a>. </p>
</p>
<p>The substations reunited in rural areas are generally of outdoor type, and most of them are unattended type. Hence for this type of applications maintenance free outdoor type, medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear is most suitable. Porcelain clad <a href="../vacuum-circuit-breaker-or-vcb-and-vacuum-interrupter/index.html">vacuum circuit breaker</a> meets this demand against the conventional indoor kiosks. </p>
<h2 id="Switching-of-Capacitive-Current">Switching of Capacitive Current</h2>
<p>The <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank is used in medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> power system to improve <a href="../electrical-power-factor/index.html" >power factor</a> of the system. Unloaded cable and unloaded overhead lines has also capacitive charging current. The <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank and unloaded power lines should be disconnected from the system safely without re-ionization. Re-ionization in the contact gap causes over <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> in the system. <a href="../vacuum-circuit-breaker-or-vcb-and-vacuum-interrupter/index.html">Vacuum circuit breaker</a> meets the requirement.<br />
While switching on a <a href="../what-is-capacitor-and-what-is-dielectric/index.html" title="What is Capacitor and Capacitance? ">capacitor</a> bank, a high rate of rise of making  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  will flow through the CB contacts. Circuit breaker with liquid quenching medium and tulip contacts may suffer from contact pin retardation. Vacuum medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear is most perfect choice for this purpose, as <a href="../vacuum-circuit-breaker-or-vcb-and-vacuum-interrupter/index.html">vacuum circuit breaker</a> has low arcing during short pre arcing time. </p>
<h2 id="Switching-of-Inductive-Current">Switching of Inductive Current</h2>
<p>Older VCB had  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  chopping level of 20A when these breakers were used to switch transformers, special <a href="../surge-protection-and-lightning-arrester-surge-arrester/index.html">surge protection device</a> were required. Modern VCB has very low chopping  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  which is about 2 - 4A. Hence modern vacuum medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear is very much suitable for switching unloaded transformer. As the modern VCB chops the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  at very low level, there is no risk of additional <a href="../surge-protection-and-lightning-arrester-surge-arrester/index.html">surge protection devices</a>. Hence VCB is suitable for very low inductive load switching. But when the inductive  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  in the system is low but not very low VCB is the best choice.</p>
<h2 id="Special-Application-of-Medium-Voltage-Switchgear">Special Application of Medium Voltage Switchgear</h2>
<h3 id="Arc-Furnace">Arc Furnace</h3>
<p>An arc furnace is required to be switch off and on frequently. The  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  to be switched may be from 0 to 8 times of the rated  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  of the furnace. An arc furnace to be switched on and off at its normal rated  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  up to 2000A, around 100 times per day. A normal, <a href="../types-and-operation-of-sf6-circuit-breaker/index.html">SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker</a>, <a href="../air-circuit-breaker-air-blast-circuit-breaker/index.html">air circuit breaker</a> and <a href="../oil-circuit-breaker-bulk-and-minimum-oil-circuit-breaker/index.html">oil circuit breaker</a> is not at all economical for this frequent operation. Standard vacuum <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> is most suitable alternative for this frequent high  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  <a href="../circuit-breaker-operation/index.html">circuit breaker operation</a>. </p>
<h3 id="Railway-Traction"> Railway Traction</h3>
<p>Another application of medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear is single phase railway track system. The main function of the <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> associated with railway traction system, is to interrupt short circuit, on the overhead catenary system which occur frequently and are transient in nature. Hence <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> used for this purpose should have, short breaking time for small contact gap, short arcing time, quick breaking, and VCB is the best possible solution. Actually arcing energy is much higher in the single phase CB than 3 phase CB. It is still much lower in a vacuum <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> than that in conventional circuit breaker. The number of short circuit occurs in the overhead catenary system  is much higher than those occurring on <a href="../electrical-power-transmission-system-and-network/index.html">electrical transmission system</a>. Medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> switchgear with vacuum <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> is most suitable for traction application. </p>
<p>It can be concluded that, in medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> system where tripping rate is very high, MV Vacuum Switchgear is most suitable solution.</p>
