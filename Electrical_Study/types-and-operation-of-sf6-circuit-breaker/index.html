<h2 id="SF<sub>6</sub>-Circuit-Breaker">SF<sub>6</sub> Circuit Breaker</h2>
<p>A <a href="../electrical-circuit-breaker-operation-and-types-of-circuit-breaker/index.html" title="Electrical Circuit Breaker">circuit breaker</a> in which the  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  carrying contacts operate in <a href="../sulfur-hexafluoride-sf6-gas-properties/index.html" >sulphur hexafluoride or SF<sub>6</sub> gas</a> is known as an <strong>SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker</strong>.</p>
<p>SF<sub>6</sub> has excellent insulating property. SF<sub>6</sub> has high electro-negativity. That means it has high affinity of absorbing free electron. Whenever a free electron collides with the SF<sub>6</sub> gas molecule, it is absorbed by that gas molecule and forms a negative ion.</p>
<p>The attachment of electron with <a href="../sulfur-hexafluoride-sf6-gas-properties/index.html">SF<sub>6</sub> gas</a> molecules may occur in two different ways,<br />
<center><img src="../equations/sf6cb-08-06-14-01.gif" alt=""></center><br />
These negative ions obviously much heavier than a free electron and therefore over all mobility of the charged particle in the SF<sub>6</sub> gas is much less as compared other common gases. We know that mobility of charged particle is majorly responsible for conducting  <a href="../electric-current-and-theory-of-electricity/index.html" title="Electric Current">electric current</a>  through a gas.<br />
<img src="../images03/sf6-circuit-breaker-001.jpg"  alt="400kv sf6 circuit breaker" title="400KV SF6 Circuit Breaker" class="alignleft"/><br />
Hence, for heavier and less mobile charged particles in <a href="../sulfur-hexafluoride-sf6-gas-properties/index.html" >SF<sub>6</sub> gas</a>, it acquires very high dielectric strength. Not only the gas has a good dielectric strength but also it has the unique property of fast recombination after the source energizing the spark is removed. The gas has also very good heat transfer property. Due to its low gaseous viscosity (because of less molecular mobility) <a href="../sulfur-hexafluoride-sf6-gas-properties/index.html" >SF<sub>6</sub> gas</a> can efficiently transfer heat by convection.  So due to its high dielectric strength and high cooling effect SF<sub>6</sub> gas is approximately 100 times more effective arc quenching media than air. Due to these unique properties of this gas <strong>SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker</strong> is used in complete range of medium <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> and high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> system. These circuit breakers are available for the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> ranges from 33KV to 800KV and even more.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="Disadvantages-of-SF<sub>6</sub>-CB">Disadvantages of SF<sub>6</sub> CB</h3>
<p>The SF<sub>6</sub> gas is identified as a greenhouse gas, safety regulation are being introduced in many countries in order to prevent its release into atmosphere.</p>
<p>Puffer type design of SF<sub>6</sub> CB needs a high mechanical energy which is almost five times greater than that of <a href="../oil-circuit-breaker-bulk-and-minimum-oil-circuit-breaker/index.html">oil circuit breaker</a>.<br />
<img src="../images03/132kv-sf6-circuit-breaker.jpg" alt="sf6 circuit breaker" title="SF6 Circuit Breaker" class="aligncenter"/>   </p>
<h2 id="Types-of-SF<sub>6</sub>-Circuit-Breaker">Types of SF<sub>6</sub> Circuit Breaker</h2>
<p>There are mainly three types of SF<sub>6</sub> CB depending upon the <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> level of application-</p>
<ol>
<li>Single interrupter SF<sub>6</sub> CB applied for up to 245 KV(220 KV) system.</li>
<li>Two interrupter SF<sub>6</sub> CB applied for up to 420 KV(400 KV) system.</li>
<li>Four interrupter SF<sub>6</sub> CB applied for up to 800 KV(715 KV) system.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Working-of-SF<sub>6</sub>-Circuit-Breaker">Working of SF<sub>6</sub> Circuit Breaker</h2>
<p>The working of SF<sub>6</sub> CB of first generation was quite simple it is some extent similar to air blast circuit breaker. Here SF<sub>6</sub> gas was compressed and stored in a high pressure reservoir. During <strong>operation of SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker</strong> this highly compressed gas is released through the <a href="../what-is-arc-arc-in-circuit-breaker/index.html">arc in breaker</a> and collected to relatively low pressure reservoir and then it pumped back to the high pressure reservoir for re utilize.</p>
<p>The <strong>working of SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker</strong> is little bit different in modern time. Innovation of puffer type design makes operation of SF<sub>6</sub> CB much easier. In buffer type design, the arc energy is utilized to develop pressure in the arcing chamber for <a href="../arc-interruption-theory/index.html">arc quenching</a>.<br />
<img src="../images03/puffer-sf6-circuit-breaker-01.gif" alt="operation of sf6 circuit breaker" title="Operation of SF6 Circuit Breaker" class="aligncenter"/><br />
<img src="../images03/puffer-sf6-circuit-breaker-02.gif" alt="working of sf6 circuit breaker" title="Working of SF6 Circuit Breaker" class="aligncenter"/><br />
Here the breaker is filled with SF<sub>6</sub> gas at rated pressure. There are two fixed contact fitted with a specific contact gap. A sliding cylinder bridges these to fixed contacts. The cylinder can axially slide upward and downward along the contacts. There is one stationary piston inside the cylinder which is fixed with other stationary parts of the SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breaker, in such a way that it can not change its position during the movement of the cylinder. As the piston is fixed and cylinder is movable or sliding, the internal volume of the cylinder changes when the cylinder slides.</p>
<p><a href="../circuit-breaker-operation/index.html">During opening of the breaker</a> the cylinder moves downwards against position of the fixed piston hence the volume inside the cylinder is reduced which produces compressed SF<sub>6</sub> gas inside the cylinder. The cylinder has numbers of side vents which were blocked by upper fixed contact body during closed position. As the cylinder move further downwards, these vent openings cross the upper fixed contact, and become unblocked and then compressed SF<sub>6</sub> gas inside the cylinder will come out through this vents in high speed towards the arc and passes through the axial hole of the both fixed contacts. The arc is quenched during this flow of SF<sub>6</sub> gas.</p>
<p><a href="../circuit-breaker-operation/index.html">During closing of the circuit breaker</a>, the sliding cylinder moves upwards and as the position of piston remains at fixed height, the volume of the cylinder increases which introduces low pressure inside the cylinder compared to the surrounding. Due to this pressure difference SF<sub>6</sub> gas from surrounding will try to enter in the cylinder. The higher pressure gas will come through the axial hole of both fixed contact and enters into cylinder via vent and during this flow; the gas will quench the arc.</p>
