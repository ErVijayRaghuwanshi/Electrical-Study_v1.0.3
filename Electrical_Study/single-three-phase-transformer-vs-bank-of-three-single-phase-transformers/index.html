<h2 id="Comparison-between-Single-Three-Phase-and-Bank-of-Three-Single-Phase-Transformers-for-Three-Phase -System"> Comparison between Single Three Phase and Bank of Three Single Phase Transformers for Three Phase System</h2>
<p>It is found that generation, transmission and distribution of <a href="../electric-power-single-and-three-phase/index.html" title="Single and Three Phase Electric Power ">electrical power</a> are more economical in <a href="../three-phase-circuit-star-and-delta-system/index.html" title="Three Phase Star and Delta System">three phase system</a> than single phase system. For <a href="../three-phase-circuit-star-and-delta-system/index.html" title="Three Phase Star and Delta System">three phase system</a> three single phase transformers are required. Three phase transformation can be done in two ways, by using single <strong>three phase transformer</strong> or by using a bank of <strong>three single phase transformers</strong>. Both are having some advantages over other. Single <strong>3 phase transformer</strong> costs around 15% less than bank of <strong>three single phase transformers</strong>. Again former occupies less space than later. For very big transformer, it is impossible to transport large <strong>three phase transformer</strong> to the site and it is easier to transport <strong>three single phase transformers</strong> which is erected separately to form a three phase unit. Another advantage of using bank of <strong>three single phase transformers</strong> is that, if one unit of the bank becomes out of order, then the bank can be run as open delta.</p>
<h2 id="Connection-of-Three-Phase-Transformer">Connection of Three Phase Transformer</h2>
<p>A verity of <strong>connection of three phase transformer</strong> are possible on each side of both a single <strong>3 phase transformer</strong> or a bank of three single phase transformers.</p>
<h3 id="Marking-or-Labeling-the-Different-Terminals-of-Transformer">Marking or Labeling the Different Terminals of Transformer</h3>
<p>Terminals of each phase of HV side should be labeled as capital letters, A, B, C, and those of LV side should be labeled as small letters, a, b, c. Terminal polarities are indicated by suffixes 1 &amp; 2. Suffix 1’s indicate similar polarity ends and so do 2’s.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="Star-Star-Transformer">Star-Star Transformer</h2>
<p><img src="../images/star-star-transformer.gif" alt="star star three phase transformer" title="Diagram of Star - Star Three Phase Transformer" class="alignright" /><br />
<strong>Star-star transformer</strong> is formed in a 3 phase transformer by connecting one terminal of each phase of individual side, together. The common terminal is indicated by suffix 1 in the figure below. If terminal with suffix 1 in both primary and secondary are used as common terminal, voltages of primary and secondary are in same phase. That is why this connection is called zero degree connection or 0&deg; - connection. </p>
<p>If the terminals with suffix 1 is connected together in HV side as common point and the terminals with suffix 2 in LV side are connected together as common point, the voltages in primary and secondary will be in opposite phase. Hence, <strong>star-star transformer</strong> connection is called  180&deg;-connection, of three phase transformer.</p>
<h2 id="Delta-Delta-Transformer">Delta-Delta Transformer</h2>
<p>In <strong>delta-delta transformer</strong>, 1 suffixed terminals of each phase primary winding will be connected with 2 suffixed terminal of next phase primary winding.<br />
<img src="../images/delta-delta-transformer.gif" style="float:right;" alt="delta delta three phase transformer" title="Diagram of Delta - Delta Three Phase Transformer" class="alignright"/><br />
 If primary is HV side, then A<sub>1</sub> will be connected to B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>1</sub> will be connected to C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>1</sub> will be connected to A<sub>2</sub>. Similarly in LV side 1 suffixed terminals of each phase winding will be connected with 2 suffixed terminals of next phase winding. That means, a<sub>1</sub> will be connected to b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub> will be connected to c<sub>2</sub> and c<sub>1</sub> will be connected to a<sub>2</sub>. If transformer leads are taken out from primary and secondary 2 suffixed terminals of the winding, then there will be no phase difference between similar line voltages in primary and secondary. This <strong>delta delta transformer</strong> connection is zero degree connection or 0&deg;-connection.</p>
<p>But in LV side of transformer, if, a<sub>2</sub> is connected to b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub> is connected to c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub> is connected to a<sub>1</sub>. The secondary leads of transformer are taken out from 2 suffixed terminals of LV windings, and then similar line voltages in primary and secondary will be in phase opposition. This connection is called 180&deg;-connection, of three phase transformer.</p>
<h2 id="Star-Delta-Transformer">Star-Delta Transformer</h2>
<p>Here in <strong>star-delta transformer</strong>, star connection in HV side is formed by connecting all the 1 suffixed terminals together as common point and transformer primary leads are taken out from 2 suffixed terminals of primary windings.<br />
<img src="../images/star-delta-transformer.gif" alt="star delta three phase transformer" title="Diagram of Star - Delta Three Phase Transformer" class="alignright"/><br />
The delta connection in LV side is formed by connecting 1 suffixed terminals of each phase LV winding with 2 suffixed terminal of next phase LV winding. More clearly, a<sub>1</sub> is connected to b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub> is connected to c<sub>2</sub> and c<sub>1</sub> is connected to a<sub>2</sub>. The secondary (here it considered as LV) leads are taken out from 2 suffixed ends of the secondary windings of transformer. The <strong>transformer connection</strong> diagram is shown in the figure beside. It is seen from the figure that the sum of the voltages in delta side is zero. This is a must as otherwise closed delta would mean a short circuit. It is also observed from the phasor diagram that, phase to neutral <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> (equivalent star basis) on the delta side lags by &minus; 30&deg; to the phase to neutral <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> on the star side; this is also the phase relationship between the respective line to line voltages. This <strong>star delta transformer</strong> connection is therefore known as  &minus; 30&deg;-connection.</p>
<p>Star-delta + 30&deg;-connection is also possible by connecting secondary terminals in following sequence.  a<sub>2</sub> is connected to b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub> is connected to c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub> is  connected to a<sub>1</sub>. The secondary leads of transformer are taken out from 2 suffixed terminals of LV windings,</p>
<p><img src="../images/delta-star-transformer.gif" style="float:right;" alt="delta star three phase transformer" title="Diagram of Delta - Star Three Phase Transformer" class="alignright"/></p>
<h2 id="Delta-Star-Transformer">Delta-Star Transformer</h2>
<p><strong>Delta-star transformer</strong> connection of three phase transformer is similar to star – delta connection. If any one interchanges HV side and LV side of star-delta transformer in diagram, it simply becomes delta – star connected 3 phase transformer. That means all small letters of star-delta connection should be replaced by capital letters and all small letters by capital in <strong>delta-star transformer </strong>connection.</p>
<h2 id="Delta-Zigzag-Transformer">Delta-Zigzag Transformer</h2>
<p>The winding of each phase on the star connected side is divided into two equal halves in <strong>delta zig zag transformer</strong>. Each leg of the <a href="../core-of-transformer-and-design-of-transformer-core/index.html" >core of transformer</a> is wound by half winding from two different secondary phases in addition to its primary winding. </p>

<h2 id="Choice-Between-Star-Connection-and-Delta-Connection-of-Three-Phase-Transformer">Choice Between Star Connection and Delta Connection of Three Phase Transformer</h2>
<p>In star connection with earthed neutral, phase <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> i.e. phase to neutral voltage, is 1/&radic;3 times of line <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> i.e. line to line voltage. But in the case of delta connection phase <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> is equal to line voltage. Star connected high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> side <a href="../electrical-power-transformer-definition-and-types-of-transformer/index.html" >electrical power transformer</a> is about 10% cheaper than that of delta connected high <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> side transformer.</p>
<p>Let’s explain,</p>
<p>Let, the <a href="../emf-equation-of-transformer-turns-voltage-transformation-ratio-of-transformer/index.html" >voltage ratio of transformer</a> between HV &amp; LV is K, <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across HV winding is V<sub>H</sub> and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across LV winding is V<sub>L</sub> and <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> across transformer leads in HV side say V<sub>p</sub> and in LV say V<sub>s</sub>.</p>
<h4>In Star-Star Transformer</h4>
<p>V<sub>H</sub> = V<sub>p</sub>/&radic;3 and V<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>s</sub>/&radic;3<br />
&rArr; V<sub>p</sub> / V<sub>s</sub> = V<sub>H</sub> / V<sub>L </sub> = K<br />
&rArr; V<sub>H</sub> = K. V<sub>L </sub><br />
Voltage difference between HV &#038; LV winding,<br />
<center>V<sub>H</sub> &minus; V<sub>L </sub> = V<sub>p</sub> &minus; V<sub>s</sub> = (K &minus; 1).V<sub>s</sub></center> </p>
<h4>In Star-Delta Transformer</h4>
<p>V<sub>H</sub> = V<sub>p</sub>/&radic;3 and V<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>s</sub><br />
Voltage difference between HV &#038; LV winding,<br />
<center>V<sub>H</sub> &minus; V<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>p</sub>/&radic;3  &minus; V<sub>s</sub> = (K/&radic;3 &minus; 1).V<sub>s</sub></center></p>
<h4>In Delta-Star Transformer</h4>
<p>V<sub>H</sub> = V<sub>p</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>s</sub>/&radic;3<br />
Voltage difference between HV &#038; LV winding,<br />
 <center>V<sub>H</sub> &minus; V<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>p</sub>  &minus; V<sub>s</sub>/&radic;3  = (K &minus; 1/&radic;3) .V<sub>s</sub></center></p>
<h4>For 132/33KV Transformer K = 4</h4>
<p><b>Case 1</b><br />
Voltage difference between HV &amp; LV winding,<br />
<center>(4 &minus; 1)V<sub>s</sub> = 3.V<sub>s</sub></center><br />
<b>Case 2</b><br />
Voltage difference between HV &amp; LV winding,<br />
<center>(4/&radic;3 &minus; 1)V<sub>s</sub> = 1.3 V<sub>s</sub></center><br />
<b>Case 3</b><br />
Voltage difference between HV &amp; LV winding,<br />
<center>(4 &minus; 1/&radic;3)V<sub>s</sub> = 3.42V<sub>s</sub></center></p>
<p>In case 2 <a href="../voltage-or-electric-potential-difference/index.html" title="Voltage or Electric Potential Difference">voltage</a> difference between HV and LV winding is minimum therefore potential stresses between them is minimum, implies insulation cost in between these windings is also less. Hence for step down purpose star–delta <strong>transformer connection</strong> is most economical, design for transformer. Similarly it can be proved that for step up purpose delta-star <strong>three phase transformer connection</strong> is most economical.</p>
